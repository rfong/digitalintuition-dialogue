79.0\115.0\D\1.16\3.1\Right.\1.0\7.0\\\\P\

88.0\125.0\P\1.16\2.11\It's pretty much the same.  \5.0\7.0\\\\P\
88.0\126.0\P\1.16\2.4\I think that it's just I haven't been as active.\10.0\7.0\\\\P\
89.0\127.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay.  Okay. \2.0\7.0\\\\P\5.0
89.0\128.0\D\6.0\1.222\ Um The fact that you felt more tired and you think could be the medication.\15.0\5.0\Zetia\\\P\
90.0\129.0\P\6.0\2.12\I was just trying to think why.\7.0\5.0\\\\P\
91.0\130.0\D\6.0\3.1\Right.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
92.0\131.0\P\6.0\2.1\And I happened to see the advertisement on TV\9.0\5.0\\\\P\
93.0\132.0\D\6.0\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
94.0\133.0\P\6.0\2.1\And it said it could\5.0\5.0\\\\P\
95.0\134.0\D\6.0\1.121\Cause fatigue?\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
96.0\135.0\P\6.0\2.13\Right. \1.0\5.0\\\\P\
96.0\136.0\P\6.0\2.1\ Side effect can be.\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\137.0\D\6.0\2.132\and fatigue, \2.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\138.0\D\6.0\3.6\So I understand what you're saying. \6.0\5.0\\\\E\
97.0\139.0\D\6.0\1.122\ You're saying you kind of based your fatigue on since you have coincide with the initiation of this medication, \19.0\5.0\\\\E\
97.0\140.0\D\6.0\82.1\but\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
98.0\141.0\P\6.0\2.4\Possibly.  Possibly.  Possibly when\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
99.0\142.0\D\6.0\82.0\But do you think, since you started with the medication, has this fatigue, \13.0\5.0\\\\P\
99.0\143.0\D\1.14\1.121\so the fatigue got worse, \5.0\5.0\\\\P\
99.0\144.0\D\1.14\1.121\and then it just stay at that level\8.0\5.0\\\\P\
100.0\145.0\P\1.14\2.13\yeah [3w]\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
101.0\146.0\D\1.14\1.121\or it's getting progressively worse?\5.0\5.0\\\\P\
102.0\147.0\P\1.14\2.13\No, not worse\3.0\5.0\\\\P\
103.0\148.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
104.0\149.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's more constant.\3.0\5.0\\\\P\
105.0\150.0\D\1.14\3.6\A little more, okay.\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
106.0\151.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
107.0\152.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay. \1.0\5.0\\\\P\
107.0\153.0\D\1.14\2.121\ So we'll look into that.  \5.0\5.0\\\\A\
107.0\154.0\D\1.15\3.5\Now since you brought up the cholesterol issue, \8.0\8.0\cholesterol\4.1\P\R\
107.0\155.0\D\3.0\2.5\and I have to see when was the last time we checked it, \13.0\8.0\\\\P\
107.0\156.0\D\3.0\2.12\because you're definitely due for another to be\8.0\8.0\\\\R\
108.0\157.0\P\3.0\2.12\I think we checked last time, \6.0\8.0\\\\P\
108.0\158.0\P\3.0\5.1\but we can check with them \6.0\8.0\\\\P\
108.0\159.0\P\3.0\81.0\[3w].\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
109.0\160.0\D\3.0\2.4\Easy enough. \2.0\8.0\\\\R\
109.0\161.0\D\3.0\2.66\ Good, \1.0\8.0\\\\P\

115.0\168.0\D\1.15\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\8.0\\\\P\
115.0\169.0\D\1.15\2.1\but it has sugar, \4.0\8.0\\\\P\
115.0\170.0\D\1.15\82.1\so that's, that would\4.0\8.0\\\\P\
116.0\171.0\P\1.15\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\8.0\\\\P\
116.0\172.0\P\1.15\2.11\but 930 last night\4.0\8.0\\\\P\

123.0\186.0\D\6.0\2.1\The only reason we will do it today is because we added a new medication for your cholesterol, \18.0\8.0\\\\R\
123.0\187.0\D\82.0\82.0\so, now I know\4.0\8.0\\\\P\

126.0\194.0\P\3.2\2.13\Right, yeah, \2.0\9.0\\\\P\
126.0\195.0\P\3.2\2.5\and I can't do that right now, but\8.0\9.0\\\\P\
127.0\196.0\D\3.2\1.122\You cannot?\2.0\9.0\\\\P\
128.0\197.0\P\3.2\2.5\No. \1.0\9.0\\\\P\
128.0\198.0\P\3.2\2.11\ I told him I wouldn't be able to right now.\10.0\9.0\\\\R\2.2
129.0\199.0\D\3.2\1.121\Too busy, or?\3.0\9.0\\\\R\
130.0\200.0\P\3.2\2.5\It's just, you know, it's running down here\8.0\9.0\\\\R\
131.0\201.0\D\3.2\3.1\oh yeah\2.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\202.0\P\3.2\81.0\[5w] \1.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\203.0\P\3.2\2.4\I think eight times, \4.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\204.0\P\3.2\2.121\and then he'll have to put me on some other type of agent I wasn't quite sure of, \18.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\205.0\P\3.2\2.61\and I'm afraid, I'm, \4.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\206.0\P\3.2\3.7\this may sound strange, \4.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\207.0\P\11.0\11.0\but I'm afraid to change anything, \6.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\208.0\P\3.2\2.4\because everything's going so well, \5.0\9.0\\\\R\
132.0\209.0\P\3.2\2.61\and it's just, I'm just afraid.\6.0\9.0\\\\R\
133.0\210.0\D\3.2\6.2\So we'll do whatever you want, obviously.  \7.0\9.0\\\\R\
133.0\211.0\D\3.2\5.6\It's your decision, \3.0\9.0\\\\R\
133.0\212.0\D\3.2\81.0\I'll go along [crosstalk 5w]\5.0\9.0\\\\83.0\
134.0\213.0\P\6.0\2.4\Cuz what you have me on now is just, has been working so well for so long\17.0\9.0\\\\P\
135.0\214.0\D\6.0\2.2\I know.\2.0\9.0\\\\P\
136.0\215.0\P\1.14\2.1\And I haven't had any problems.\6.0\9.0\\\\P\
137.0\216.0\D\1.14\2.45\I know.  No I understand, you\6.0\9.0\\\\E\
138.0\217.0\P\1.14\2.4\All it takes is one\5.0\9.0\\\\E\
139.0\218.0\D\1.14\2.63\[Laughs].\1.0\9.0\\\\E\
140.0\219.0\P\11.0\11.0\You know, one change and it could throw everything off.\10.0\9.0\\\\E\4.6
141.0\220.0\D\3.2\5.1\So let's just talk about this study\7.0\9.0\\\\A\
142.0\221.0\P\3.2\3.1\Okay.\1.0\9.0\\\\A\
143.0\222.0\D\3.2\5.6\And again, it's ultimately your decision, \6.0\9.0\\\\R\
143.0\223.0\D\3.2\5.6\you don't have to do anything\6.0\9.0\\\\R\
144.0\224.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\R\
145.0\225.0\D\3.2\2.121\It will not affect your care here in any way, whatever you decide.\13.0\9.0\\\\R\
146.0\226.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\R\
147.0\227.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay? \1.0\9.0\\\\R\
147.0\228.0\D\3.2\2.45\ And I understand you reluctance to do all this \9.0\9.0\\\\R\
147.0\229.0\D\1.14\2.14\because when you came here the very first time, I remember how very sick you were, \16.0\9.0\\\\R\
147.0\230.0\D\1.14\2.14\and how long it took us to get you in good shape \12.0\9.0\\\\R\
147.0\231.0\D\5.1\2.14\and you know, how long [6w] ramp up the medications that you were taking.\14.0\9.0\\\\R\
148.0\232.0\P\5.1\3.1\Oh yeah.\2.0\9.0\\\\R\
149.0\233.0\D\3.2\2.4\But this should give you a very clear idea about this study. \12.0\9.0\\\\R\
149.0\234.0\D\3.2\2.1\ First, Dr. [name of endocrine doctor] is actually a colleague \10.0\9.0\\\\I\
149.0\235.0\D\3.2\2.1\who we work very closely together \6.0\9.0\\\\I\
149.0\236.0\D\3.2\2.1\and has done really a lot of very important work on the area of HIV \15.0\9.0\\\\I\
149.0\237.0\D\3.2\2.1\and metabolic abnormalities.\3.0\9.0\\\\I\
150.0\238.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
151.0\239.0\D\3.2\2.1\and By that I say,  abnormal sugar levels\8.0\9.0\\\\I\
152.0\240.0\P\3.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
153.0\241.0\D\3.2\11.0\in the blood \3.0\9.0\\\\I\
153.0\242.0\D\3.2\2.1\that caused by HIV medications \5.0\9.0\\\\I\
153.0\243.0\D\3.2\2.1\and HIV cells.\3.0\9.0\\\\I\
154.0\244.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
155.0\245.0\D\3.2\2.1\Some of the patients who use [6w] \7.0\9.0\\\\I\
155.0\246.0\D\3.2\2.1\which they call atrophy [1w]\5.0\9.0\\\\I\
156.0\247.0\P\3.2\3.1\Right, right.\2.0\9.0\\\\I\
157.0\248.0\D\3.2\2.1\I mean [4w] feeling nicely now.  \6.0\9.0\\\\P\
157.0\249.0\D\82.0\82.0\I can, \2.0\9.0\\\\P\
157.0\250.0\D\1.14\2.1\your face is filling back in\6.0\9.0\\\\P\
158.0\251.0\P\1.0\2.12\I'm sure that has to do with the weight I've gained, too.\12.0\9.0\\\\P\
159.0\252.0\D\1.0\2.43\Yeah yeah yeah.\3.0\9.0\\\\P\
160.0\253.0\P\1.0\2.5\But I don't want to gain any weight.\8.0\9.0\\\\P\
161.0\254.0\D\1.0\2.45\No I understand. \3.0\9.0\\\\P\
161.0\255.0\D\3.2\2.4\ So, but this study that he's doing is actually, it is it is quite important. \15.0\9.0\\\\I\
161.0\256.0\D\3.2\2.1\ He is using a new medication called fish oil. \9.0\9.0\\\\I\
161.0\257.0\D\3.2\2.1\ Fish oil is actually what's considered for many years an alternative therapy\12.0\9.0\\\\I\
162.0\258.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\259.0\D\3.2\83.0\Cuz of Superman, \3.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\260.0\D\3.2\2.1\that did not have to go to the level approvals through the FDA \13.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\261.0\D\3.2\2.1\like the other many drugs that you're taking. \8.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\262.0\D\3.2\2.1\ But then eventually it was tested \6.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\263.0\D\3.2\2.1\and was actually used to treat HIV infected patients \9.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\264.0\D\3.2\2.1\who were taking some of the HIV medications you are taking now, \12.0\9.0\\\\I\
163.0\265.0\D\3.2\2.1\it had a problem with the cholesterol\7.0\9.0\\\\I\
164.0\266.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
165.0\267.0\D\3.2\2.1\Um And it did help a little bit.\8.0\9.0\\\\I\
166.0\268.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
167.0\269.0\D\3.2\2.1\So what's, Dr. [name of doctor] is doing the next step of that study to try to understand a little more about this fact of the specific medication fish oil on the cholesterol level.\34.0\9.0\\\\I\
168.0\270.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
169.0\271.0\D\3.2\2.1\It has been a study with HIV medications \8.0\9.0\\\\I\
169.0\272.0\D\3.2\2.4\it does not seem to affect the levels of HIV medications. \11.0\9.0\\\\I\
169.0\273.0\D\3.2\2.4\ In other words, it will probably not lower or increase the levels of the HIV medications that you're taking right now.\21.0\9.0\\\\I\
170.0\274.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
171.0\275.0\D\3.2\11.0\Okay?  \1.0\9.0\\\\I\
171.0\276.0\D\3.2\3.7\Um And as far as we know, \7.0\9.0\\\\I\
171.0\277.0\D\3.2\2.4\it doesn't seem like the HIV medications will affect the levels of this new medication called fish oil.\18.0\9.0\\\\I\
172.0\278.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
173.0\279.0\D\3.2\82.1\Um Fish oil is\4.0\9.0\\\\I\
174.0\280.0\P\3.2\1.12\Is there another name for it?\6.0\9.0\\\\I\
175.0\281.0\D\3.2\2.1\Omacor.  OMACOR.\2.0\9.0\\\\I\
176.0\282.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
177.0\283.0\D\3.2\2.1\So it was an actual medication, \6.0\9.0\\\\I\
177.0\284.0\D\3.2\3.7\as I explained to you, \5.0\9.0\\\\I\
177.0\285.0\D\3.2\2.1\but then, recently it got approved as a regular drug, through the Food and Drug Administration.\16.0\9.0\\\\I\
178.0\286.0\P\3.2\3.1\Okay.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
179.0\287.0\D\3.2\2.1\So it's now FDA approved \5.0\9.0\\\\I\
179.0\288.0\D\3.2\2.1\like any of the medications that you're currently taking.\9.0\9.0\\\\I\
180.0\289.0\P\3.2\3.1\Right.  Mhm.\2.0\9.0\\\\I\
181.0\290.0\D\3.2\5.1\So one of the reasons to consider it would be to work directly with Dr. [name of doctor], \18.0\9.0\\\\I\
181.0\291.0\D\3.2\2.1\who has very good, strong knowledge on the control of cholesterol in general, \13.0\9.0\\\\I\
181.0\292.0\D\3.2\2.1\but understands that there are other perspective of HIV infection.\10.0\9.0\\\\I\
182.0\293.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
183.0\294.0\D\1.16\3.7\But as you know, \4.0\9.0\\\\P\
183.0\295.0\D\1.16\2.14\you have been trying to do everything right\8.0\9.0\\\\P\
184.0\296.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
185.0\297.0\D\1.16\2.13\You have been controlling your diet, \6.0\9.0\\\\P\
185.0\298.0\D\1.16\5.7\and that's helping, \3.0\9.0\\\\P\
185.0\299.0\D\1.15\2.14\but we have been struggling in trying to get you to the right levels\14.0\9.0\\\\P\
186.0\300.0\P\1.15\3.1\Right.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
187.0\301.0\D\6.0\2.14\Even though you're taking a lot of the medications to lower cholesterol.\12.0\9.0\\\\P\
188.0\302.0\P\6.0\3.1\Right.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
189.0\303.0\D\1.15\5.1\So my only suggestion would be if we check it again, even with this medication on board, \17.0\9.0\\\\P\
189.0\304.0\D\1.15\2.121\and we are not at the level where we should be, \11.0\9.0\\\\P\
189.0\305.0\D\3.2\5.1\you can consider whether you'd be interested, again, in doing this study or not.\14.0\9.0\\\\R\
190.0\306.0\P\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\R\
191.0\307.0\D\3.2\5.1\Even if you decided you're not interested in doing this study, we can still ask Dr. [name of doctor] to see you outside of the study\26.0\9.0\\\\R\
192.0\308.0\P\3.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\R\
193.0\309.0\D\3.0\2.1\Just to see if he had any suggestions. \8.0\9.0\\\\R\
193.0\310.0\D\82.0\82.0\ He's actually, \2.0\9.0\\\\I\
193.0\311.0\D\83.0\2.14\now that you know that [5w] here, \7.0\9.0\\\\I\
193.0\312.0\D\1.14\2.12\you could be having a little bit more fatigue\9.0\9.0\\\\I\
194.0\313.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
195.0\314.0\D\3.2\2.5\But I just thought that it was important for us to talk about this study, \15.0\9.0\\\\R\
195.0\315.0\D\3.2\2.5\just so you understand this is not someone who you know [crosstalk 6w]\13.0\9.0\\\\R\
196.0\316.0\P\3.2\2.1\Well he said that\4.0\9.0\\\\P\
197.0\317.0\D\3.2\2.4\He's really excellent.\3.0\9.0\\\\P\
198.0\318.0\P\3.2\11.0\That you recommended that he call me. \7.0\9.0\\\\P\
198.0\319.0\P\3.2\2.4\ I have no problems with anything that you say, \9.0\9.0\\\\R\
198.0\320.0\P\3.2\3.7\to be honest\3.0\9.0\\\\R\
199.0\321.0\D\3.2\3.6\Okay. \1.0\9.0\\\\R\
199.0\322.0\D\3.2\4.1\ But your concern, in addition, of  messing up  the good picture here\12.0\9.0\\\\R\
200.0\323.0\P\3.2\2.61\[Crosstalk 6w] the different medications that I may be going on\11.0\9.0\\\\R\
201.0\324.0\D\6.0\2.1\You are already taking one of them.\7.0\9.0\\\\R\
202.0\325.0\P\6.0\1.122\Oh am I?\3.0\9.0\\\\P\
203.0\326.0\D\6.0\2.13\Yes.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
204.0\327.0\P\6.0\2.1\See they're different names, so\5.0\9.0\\\\I\
205.0\328.0\D\6.0\2.2\Yeah, I know.\3.0\9.0\\\\I\
206.0\329.0\P\6.0\2.2\I only know them by\5.0\9.0\\\\P\
207.0\330.0\D\6.0\3.6\I know.  Yeah.\3.0\9.0\\\\P\
208.0\331.0\P\6.0\11.0\The names that I go by.\6.0\9.0\\\\P\
209.0\332.0\D\6.0\3.6\Yeah. \1.0\9.0\\\\P\
209.0\333.0\D\6.0\2.2\ No I know, you are already taking one of them.\10.0\9.0\\\\P\
210.0\334.0\P\3.2\2.1\But he mentioned two\4.0\9.0\\\\I\
211.0\335.0\D\3.2\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
212.0\336.0\P\3.2\2.121\And then it would be, I'd have to come in to see a dietician\14.0\9.0\\\\I\
213.0\337.0\D\3.2\3.1\Right.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
214.0\338.0\P\11.0\11.0\Several times\2.0\9.0\\\\I\
215.0\339.0\D\3.2\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
216.0\340.0\P\3.2\2.121\And then I think I'd have to come I think eight times.\12.0\9.0\\\\I\
217.0\341.0\D\3.2\3.1\Yeah, \1.0\9.0\\\\I\
217.0\342.0\D\3.2\1.221\so that's too much for you, right?\7.0\9.0\\\\R\
218.0\343.0\P\3.2\2.4\Well right now, it's a little bit\7.0\9.0\\\\R\
219.0\344.0\D\3.2\3.6\Fine. \1.0\9.0\\\\R\
219.0\345.0\D\1.15\5.1\ So let's check your cholesterol today.  \6.0\8.0\CHOLESTEROL\2.1\D\R\2.1
219.0\346.0\D\3.0\5.1\Things are not really what they're supposed to be, we can always talk to him\15.0\8.0\\\\I\
220.0\347.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
221.0\348.0\D\3.0\5.1\And see if he has any additional ideas, \8.0\8.0\\\\I\
221.0\349.0\D\3.0\5.1\other than what we have done so far.\8.0\8.0\\\\I\
222.0\350.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
223.0\351.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay?\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
224.0\352.0\P\1.15\2.1\I think I was really up, I was really high at one point\13.0\8.0\\\\P\
225.0\353.0\D\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
226.0\354.0\P\1.15\2.1\But then it went down to like 278\8.0\8.0\\\\P\
227.0\355.0\D\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
228.0\356.0\P\1.15\2.1\But now it's like 230something.\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
229.0\357.0\D\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
230.0\358.0\P\1.15\2.1\well [Crosstalk 4w], I has been coming down.\8.0\8.0\\\\P\
231.0\359.0\D\1.15\3.1\Yeah, \1.0\8.0\\\\P\
231.0\360.0\D\1.15\82.0\but we don't, remember\4.0\8.0\\\\P\
232.0\361.0\P\1.15\81.0\[Crosstalk 6w].\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
233.0\362.0\D\1.15\2.1\Remember we don't look only on the total cholesterol, \9.0\8.0\\\\I\
233.0\363.0\D\1.15\2.1\we also look into the bad cholesterol\7.0\8.0\\\\I\
234.0\364.0\P\1.15\3.1\Right.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
235.0\365.0\D\1.15\2.1\Which is called LDL.\4.0\8.0\\\\I\
236.0\366.0\P\1.15\3.1\Right.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
237.0\367.0\D\1.15\2.1\So we have to do several things [4w] et cetera.\10.0\8.0\\\\I\
238.0\368.0\P\1.15\1.121\But also the bad cholesterol, isn't that, for me not being as active, that could cause my cholesterol to go up \21.0\8.0\\\\I\
238.0\369.0\P\1.15\81.0\[crosstalk 3w] \2.0\8.0\\\\I\
238.0\370.0\P\1.15\1.121\the more active you are, the better those results should be, right?\12.0\8.0\\\\I\
239.0\371.0\D\1.15\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\8.0\\\\I\
