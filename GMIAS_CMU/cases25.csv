283.0\561.0\P\1.14\2.2\I cannot understand it. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
283.0\562.0\P\1.14\2.1\ When I take my clothes off, I'm skinny, \8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
283.0\563.0\P\1.14\2.61\I look like a skeleton.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
284.0\564.0\D\1.14\1.12\So where do you, do you think you are losing weight more in one area of your body? \18.0\1.0\\\\P\\
284.0\565.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Like are your legs thinner than your tummy?\8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
285.0\566.0\P\1.14\2.1\My legs is so thin. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
285.0\567.0\P\1.14\2.1\I have never seen my legs like that. \8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
285.0\568.0\P\1.14\2.2\ That's how I know I've lost weight.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
286.0\569.0\D\1.14\3.1\ok\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
287.0\570.0\P\1.14\2.1\My stomach is little.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
287.0\571.0\P\1.14\5.4\Put your hands on it, right through here.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
288.0\572.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah.  Okay.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
289.0\573.0\P\1.14\2.2\I just don't understand that.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
290.0\574.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
290.0\575.0\D\1.14\2.1\So, um, it looks like back in January of 2006, so a little over a year ago\17.0\1.0\\\\P\\
291.0\576.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
292.0\577.0\D\1.14\2.1\right?  You weighed 195.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
293.0\578.0\P\1.14\2.66\That's good.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
294.0\579.0\D\1.14\2.1\And then in May, you went down to 170.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
295.0\580.0\P\1.14\3.1\Umhum.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
296.0\581.0\D\1.14\2.1\In June you were 167.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
297.0\582.0\P\1.14\1.12\See how it's going down.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
298.0\583.0\D\1.14\2.1\But in August you went back up to 175\9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
299.0\584.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
300.0\585.0\D\1.14\2.1\In September you were about the same, 173 \8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
300.0\586.0\D\1.14\2.1\and then in November when I saw you, you were 162.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\\
301.0\587.0\P\1.14\5.4\But look at that jump from 175 to 162.  \9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
301.0\588.0\P\1.14\2.61\That's a jump for me to worry\7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\589.0\D\1.14\3.6\Right, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\590.0\D\1.14\82.0\but that's over the course of uh, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\591.0\D\1.14\2.12\that's 10 pounds, right or 13 pounds over the course of three or four months, \15.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\592.0\D\1.14\2.4\which isn't horrible \3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\593.0\D\1.14\4.1\and the thing is you are steady now.  Okay?  \9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\594.0\D\6.0\3.7\So what I was going to say to you before is that \12.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\595.0\D\6.0\2.1\looking at your medicines from psychiatry, a lot of those medicines \11.0\1.0\\\\R\\
302.0\596.0\D\6.0\2.1\like Abilify \2.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\597.0\D\6.0\2.1\and Lithium \2.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\598.0\D\6.0\2.1\and Remeron \2.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\599.0\D\6.0\2.1\and Seroquel \2.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\600.0\D\6.0\2.1\and Zyprexa, \2.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\601.0\D\6.0\2.1\all of which you have been on, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\602.0\D\6.0\2.1\can do things to your weight. \6.0\1.0\\\\I\1.3\
302.0\603.0\D\6.0\2.1\They can cause you to gain weight, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\604.0\D\6.0\2.1\they can cause you to lose weight.  \7.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\605.0\D\6.0\2.1\More often than not, it's gain weight. \7.0\1.0\\\\I\\
302.0\606.0\D\6.0\2.14\And actually, you used to be on Seroquel \8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\607.0\D\6.0\2.14\and Remeron, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\608.0\D\6.0\2.1\both of which make you gain weight \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\609.0\D\6.0\2.14\and you are not on those anymore. \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\610.0\D\6.0\2.14\ As of January, it looks like the only medicines you are on are Lamictal \14.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\611.0\D\6.0\2.14\and Lithium \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
302.0\612.0\D\6.0\2.14\and the Abilify.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
303.0\613.0\P\6.0\2.1\That was, that was for sleeping.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\\
304.0\614.0\D\6.0\2.43\Yes, it can be for sleeping, exactly. \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
304.0\615.0\D\6.0\2.1\ And it can, it can also help with just stabilizing everything.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\\
305.0\616.0\P\6.0\3.1\hmm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
306.0\617.0\D\6.0\2.4\So, what I think maybe going on is a little bit that your psychiatric medicines are coming into play\19.0\1.0\\\\P\\
307.0\618.0\P\6.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
308.0\619.0\D\6.0\2.1\and that 162 maybe the weight you are at when you are not gaining weight because of your psychiatric medicine.  \20.0\1.0\\\\P\\
308.0\620.0\D\1.14\3.3\Now, having said that, let's talk about your appetite \9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
308.0\621.0\D\1.14\1.12\and any nausea \3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
308.0\622.0\D\1.14\1.12\or vomiting, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
308.0\623.0\D\1.14\1.12\have you had any of that?\6.0\1.0\\\\P\\
309.0\624.0\P\1.14\2.1\I have nausea. \3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
309.0\625.0\P\1.14\2.2\I don't know, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
309.0\626.0\P\1.14\2.1\I vomit, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
309.0\627.0\P\1.14\2.2\but I don't know, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
309.0\628.0\P\1.14\2.1\that's from my stomach.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
310.0\629.0\D\1.14\1.122\So when you don't take the Ranitidine you get nausea?\10.0\1.0\\\\P\\
311.0\630.0\P\1.14\1.122\You talking about my stomach?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
312.0\631.0\D\1.14\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\632.0\P\1.14\2.1\I get so sick when I don't take my [2w]. \10.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\633.0\P\1.14\2.1\ I can't put no food down there.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\634.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's nausea.  \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\635.0\P\1.14\2.1\One day I vomited.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\636.0\P\1.14\2.2\I didn't know what it was.  \6.0\1.0\\\\P\\
313.0\637.0\P\1.14\2.1\And um, it's just totally different when I don't take them.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\\
314.0\638.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
314.0\639.0\D\1.14\2.1\So when you take that ranitidine, the pill we just looked at\12.0\1.0\\\\P\\
315.0\640.0\P\1.14\3.1\yeah\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
316.0\641.0\D\1.14\11.0\your appetite is good?\4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
317.0\642.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\

318.0\645.0\D\1.14\1.122\or vomiting?\2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
319.0\646.0\P\1.14\2.13\No, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
319.0\647.0\P\6.0\2.1\what it does is, it helps my stomach to take food.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\\
320.0\648.0\D\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
321.0\649.0\P\6.0\2.1\That's what it does.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
322.0\650.0\D\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
323.0\651.0\P\6.0\2.1\But then again, it doesn't \5.0\1.0\\\\P\\

381.0\738.0\P\1.14\2.1\And that's how meals are \5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\739.0\P\1.16\2.11\because I ate one piece of fish \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\740.0\P\1.16\2.11\and a half of fish, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\741.0\P\1.16\2.11\a half of bowl of potatoes \6.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\742.0\P\1.16\2.1\and I had to get up later. \7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\743.0\P\1.16\2.11\ That's what I do at night, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\744.0\P\1.16\2.11\I eat \2.0\1.0\\\\P\\
381.0\745.0\P\1.16\2.11\and I flavor food twice\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
382.0\746.0\D\1.16\3.6\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
383.0\747.0\D\1.14\2.1\and then I'm all right.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\\
384.0\748.0\D\1.16\1.121\So you eat half of it at like 600 \9.0\1.0\\\\P\\
384.0\749.0\D\1.16\1.121\and then you eat the other half of it around 8 or 9.\13.0\1.0\\\\P\\
385.0\750.0\P\1.16\2.1\12.0\1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
386.0\751.0\D\1.16\1.122\Oh, much later.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\\
387.0\752.0\P\1.16\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\\
387.0\753.0\P\1.16\2.11\I be up eating. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\\
387.0\754.0\P\1.16\2.1\ And people say I can't eat at midnight.  \8.0\1.0\\\\P\\
387.0\755.0\P\1.16\2.11\And I said, that's when I eat.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\\
388.0\756.0\D\1.12\2.1\Well, it can make your reflux worse too though.\9.0\11.0\REFLUX\4.1\D\P\\
389.0\757.0\P\1.12\1.11\What's reflux.\2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
390.0\758.0\D\1.12\2.1\Well, the acid in your stomach.\6.0\11.0\\\\P\\
391.0\759.0\P\1.12\1.11\It can, why?\3.0\11.0\\\\P\\
392.0\760.0\D\1.12\2.1\Because what happens is if you eat and then you lay down\12.0\11.0\\\\P\\
393.0\761.0\P\1.12\3.1\what?\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
394.0\762.0\D\1.12\11.0\the acid in your stomach doesn't have to work against gravity \11.0\11.0\\\\P\\
394.0\763.0\D\1.12\2.1\so when you are standing up it works against gravity, right? \11.0\11.0\\\\P\\
394.0\764.0\D\1.12\2.1\ When you are laying down it is all on one level, \11.0\11.0\\\\P\\
394.0\765.0\D\1.12\2.1\that acid can go from your stomach up in through here. \11.0\11.0\\\\P\\
394.0\766.0\D\1.16\5.1\ So really, the best thing you can do for your reflux, okay?\12.0\11.0\\\\P\\
395.0\767.0\P\1.16\3.1\mhm\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
396.0\768.0\D\1.16\11.0\is eat small meals throughout the day, \7.0\11.0\\\\P\\
396.0\769.0\D\1.16\5.1\so even if you are not feeling like it around breakfast time, even if you can eat a piece of toast.\21.0\11.0\\\\P\\
397.0\770.0\P\1.16\2.11\Before I had this acid, I wasn't eating. \8.0\11.0\\\\P\\
397.0\771.0\P\1.16\2.1\ It's been a million years since I eat breakfast, \9.0\11.0\\\\P\\
397.0\772.0\P\1.16\2.1\many ears.\2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
398.0\773.0\D\1.16\3.6\Yeah. \1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
398.0\774.0\D\1.16\5.1\ What about a piece of toast?\6.0\11.0\\\\R\\
399.0\775.0\P\1.16\2.4\I guess I could eat that.\6.0\11.0\\\\R\\
400.0\776.0\D\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\11.0\\\\R\\
401.0\777.0\P\1.16\6.2\I'm gonna try.\3.0\11.0\\\\R\\
402.0\778.0\D\1.16\5.4\You try. \2.0\11.0\\\\R\\
402.0\779.0\D\1.16\5.3\ What I would like you to do is eat like five small meals over the course of the day, okay? \20.0\11.0\\\\R\2.1\
402.0\780.0\D\1.16\5.4\ So have a piece of toast, \6.0\11.0\\\\R\\
402.0\781.0\D\1.16\5.4\um, you know, maybe have a sandwich, \7.0\11.0\\\\R\\
402.0\782.0\D\1.16\5.4\maybe have a piece of chicken.\6.0\11.0\\\\R\\
403.0\783.0\P\1.16\2.11\What I do is drink a cup of coffee \9.0\11.0\\\\P\\
403.0\784.0\P\6.0\2.11\and take my medicine. \4.0\11.0\\\\P\\
403.0\785.0\P\6.0\2.63\ [laughs]\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
404.0\786.0\D\1.16\3.1\Okay.  Well.\2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
405.0\787.0\P\1.16\2.1\It's milk in there.\4.0\11.0\\\\P\\
406.0\788.0\D\1.16\3.6\Yeah, yeah, \2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
406.0\789.0\D\1.16\2.1\the thing about coffee is coffee has caffeine\8.0\11.0\\\\I\\
407.0\790.0\P\1.16\2.2\I know.\2.0\11.0\\\\I\\
408.0\791.0\D\1.16\2.1\And caffeine um\3.0\11.0\\\\I\\
409.0\792.0\P\1.16\2.132\Is not good for that. \5.0\11.0\\\\I\\
409.0\793.0\P\1.16\2.63\ [laughs]\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
410.0\794.0\D\1.16\2.43\Exactly, exactly \2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
410.0\795.0\D\1.16\2.1\and not to mention coffee can be harsh on our stomachs anyways, \12.0\11.0\\\\I\\
410.0\796.0\D\1.16\2.1\especially if we don't have anything in there. \8.0\11.0\\\\I\\
410.0\797.0\D\1.16\5.1\ So ideally what you want to do is cut out caffeine \11.0\11.0\\\\R\2.1\
410.0\798.0\D\1.16\2.1\that means coffee, \3.0\11.0\\\\R\\
410.0\799.0\D\1.16\2.1\iced tea\2.0\11.0\\\\R\\
411.0\800.0\P\1.16\2.2\I know\2.0\11.0\\\\R\\
412.0\801.0\D\1.16\2.1\soda.\1.0\11.0\\\\R\\
413.0\802.0\P\1.16\2.2\I know.\2.0\11.0\\\\R\\
414.0\803.0\D\1.16\1.121\And you drink a lot of soda, don't you?\9.0\11.0\\\\P\\
415.0\804.0\P\1.16\2.11\I drink iced tea.\4.0\11.0\\\\P\\
416.0\805.0\D\1.16\3.1\Iced tea.\2.0\11.0\\\\P\\
417.0\806.0\P\1.16\1.121\So that stuff helps, it doesn't help your stomach?\9.0\11.0\\\\P\\
418.0\807.0\D\1.16\2.13\No, \1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
418.0\808.0\D\1.12\2.1\because what happens is you have your stomach, right? \9.0\11.0\\\\I\\
418.0\809.0\D\1.12\2.1\ And your stomachs like a little bag sitting here\9.0\11.0\\\\I\\
419.0\810.0\P\1.12\3.1\mhm\1.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\811.0\D\1.12\11.0\right? \1.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\812.0\D\1.12\2.1\ And it's got a little bit of a door \9.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\813.0\D\1.12\2.1\and the door closes most of the time, \8.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\814.0\D\1.12\2.1\except for when you eat it opens \7.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\815.0\D\1.12\2.1\and then it lets the food down. \7.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\816.0\D\1.12\2.1\ And so you to got your feeding tube above the door \11.0\11.0\\\\I\\
420.0\817.0\D\1.12\2.1\and your stomach below the door.\6.0\11.0\\\\I\\
421.0\818.0\P\1.12\3.1\hm hmm\2.0\11.0\\\\I\\
422.0\819.0\D\1.12\3.6\ok? \1.0\11.0\\\\I\\
422.0\820.0\D\1.12\2.1\ So the things that open up that door and make the acid in your stomach come up are things that are bad for your reflux.\25.0\11.0\\\\I\\
423.0\821.0\P\1.12\1.122\So I have acid reflux?\5.0\11.0\\\\R\1.12\

426.0\825.0\D\1.16\2.1\caffeine.\1.0\11.0\\\\I\\
427.0\826.0\P\1.16\2.4\That's my favorite.  \3.0\11.0\\\\P\\
427.0\827.0\P\1.16\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
428.0\828.0\D\1.16\1.12\Alcohol?\1.0\11.0\\\\I\\
429.0\829.0\P\1.16\2.11\No.\1.0\11.0\\\\I\\

436.0\841.0\D\1.16\5.5\all to make your reflux worse\6.0\11.0\\\\I\\
437.0\842.0\P\1.16\3.1\yeah\1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
438.0\843.0\D\1.16\3.6\okay?  \1.0\11.0\\\\P\\

438.0\845.0\D\1.16\1.22\do you think you can try to decrease those three things?\11.0\11.0\\\\R\2.1\
439.0\846.0\P\1.16\2.5\Sure. \1.0\11.0\\\\R\\
439.0\847.0\P\1.16\2.5\ I have to.\3.0\11.0\\\\R\\

440.0\849.0\D\1.16\5.1\You try to eat five or six small meals.\9.0\11.0\\\\R\\
441.0\850.0\P\1.16\2.11\That's what I do anyway.\5.0\11.0\\\\P\\
442.0\851.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay, \1.0\11.0\\\\P\\
442.0\852.0\D\8.0\5.3\and then the last thing I want you to do is not eat and then lay down.\17.0\11.0\\\\R\2.1\

466.0\912.0\D\1.13\6.1\ And let me show you what that looks like on the graph \12.0\3.0\\\\P\\
466.0\913.0\D\1.13\2.1\because they were higher.\4.0\3.0\\\\P\\

494.0\966.0\D\1.13\2.1\when people have their CD4 count go below 200 then we say that the HIV is now progressed to AIDS.  ok?\21.0\3.0\\\\I\\
