379.0\373.0\D\2.2\2.1\I ask because I smell a little bit of alcohol on your breath, \13.0\10.0\\\\I\
380.0\374.0\D\2.2\2.12\so usually that means someone's drinking more than just one beer three times a week.  \15.0\10.0\\\\I\
381.0\375.0\D\2.2\2.12\Usually that means that someone's drinking every day \8.0\10.0\\\\I\

383.0\377.0\D\2.2\2.12\ But several beers, maybe, \4.0\10.0\\\\I\

387.0\381.0\D\5.114\2.1\ Because sometimes that interferes with being able to keep up with your medicine, \13.0\10.0\\\\I\
388.0\382.0\D\5.11\2.2\and I know you've been on and off it. \9.0\10.0\\\\P\

391.0\385.0\D\1.14\2.1\um and uh your blood pressure's up a little bit. \10.0\10.0\\\\P\
392.0\386.0\D\2.2\2.1\ Sometimes alcohol affects the blood pressure, \6.0\10.0\\\\I\
393.0\387.0\D\2.2\2.1\and it can affect people\5.0\10.0\\\\I\

395.0\389.0\D\2.2\2.1\If people are drinking, often they're not eating that well \10.0\10.0\\\\I\
396.0\390.0\D\2.2\2.1\and losing weight, \3.0\10.0\\\\I\
397.0\391.0\D\2.2\2.1\so it could figure into a lot of things, \9.0\10.0\\\\I\
398.0\392.0\D\2.2\1.11\that's why I'm curious to know really what's going on with that.\12.0\10.0\\\\E\
