65.0\118.0\P\5.14\2.13\Mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\119.0\D\5.14\3.6\Epzicom.  \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\120.0\D\5.14\2.14\Reyataz \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\121.0\D\5.14\2.14\and Norvir \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\122.0\D\5.14\2.14\and Bactrim. \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\123.0\D\5.14\5.4\ Take them all together, \\1.0\\\\R\
66.0\124.0\D\5.14\5.4\once a day.\\1.0\\\\R\
67.0\125.0\P\5.14\1.22\You prefer to do it in the morning when I wake up, or?\\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\126.0\D\5.14\2.4\I prefer the morning, \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\127.0\D\5.14\2.4\just because that's usually the best time that you take it with your breakfast. \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\128.0\D\5.4\5.1\ So what I recommend is that, you know, what works for me when I'm on medicine is to put it on the kitchen table, \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\129.0\D\5.4\2.1\cuz I always have breakfast in the same spot, \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\130.0\D\5.4\2.1\and then I have that visual reminder when I sit down at the table for breakfast - \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\131.0\D\5.4\2.1\there are the pills sitting right there - \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\132.0\D\5.4\2.1\reminds me to take my meds that time, that day.  Okay? \\1.0\\\\R\1.3
68.0\133.0\D\5.14\2.14\ So you're on the Reyataz, \\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\134.0\D\5.14\5.1\ which is probably best to take with a meal, \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\135.0\D\5.14\5.1\and Epzicom can be taken with or without a meal, \\1.0\\\\R\
68.0\136.0\D\5.14\2.4\so there's no problem there.\\1.0\\\\R\
69.0\137.0\P\5.2\2.1\[I don't have a problem with eating - \\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\138.0\P\5.2\2.1\it's just if I don't eat, \\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\139.0\P\5.2\2.1\I take it, I get sick.]\\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\140.0\D\5.2\3.6\Yeah. Yeah. \\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\141.0\D\5.2\5.4\ So take them with your breakfast, \\1.0\\\\R\
70.0\142.0\D\5.14\5.4\one a day, once a day, and you're done.  \\1.0\\\\R\
70.0\143.0\D\5.1\5.5\And that's what's going to have a big positive impact on you - \\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\144.0\D\5.1\5.5\it's really gonna help.\\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\145.0\P\5.1\3.1\OK\\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\146.0\D\5.4\5.3\I just gotta work with you to get that done.  Okay?\\1.0\\\\P\
