169.0\393.0\P\1.14\2.1\\not stress, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
169.0\394.0\P\1.14\2.1\\it's uh, like when you get just gently doing something \14.0\heart health\\\P\
169.0\395.0\P\1.14\2.1\\and you just sit there and take a breath like, you know, \14.0\heart health\\\P\

171.0\401.0\P\1.14\2.11\\ And if you have any [5w] you go home. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
171.0\402.0\P\1.14\2.4\\ And maybe it's nothing to go through. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
171.0\403.0\P\1.14\2.1\\ So, it hasn't affected me to the degree that um, I'm concerned, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
171.0\404.0\P\1.14\2.1\\but to the degree that I can't perform.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
172.0\405.0\D\1.14\1.12\\But does the pain go anywhere else?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
173.0\406.0\P\1.14\2.1\\No, right here.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
174.0\407.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Do you get sweaty when you have it?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
175.0\408.0\P\1.14\2.1\\No.\14.0\heart health\\\P\

180.0\414.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Do you feel short of breath with it?\14.0\heart health\\\P\

190.0\431.0\D\3.0\2.1\\not cardiology, the heart doctor.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
191.0\432.0\P\3.0\3.6\\Yeah, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
191.0\433.0\P\3.0\2.1\\that's hematology, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
191.0\434.0\P\3.0\2.1\\she's the Coumadin lady.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
192.0\435.0\D\3.0\3.6\\Right. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
192.0\436.0\D\3.0\1.121\\ So you aren't really seeing the cardiology doctor?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
193.0\437.0\P\3.0\2.13\\No.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
194.0\438.0\D\3.0\2.5\\And I don't really want to overburden you with cardiology, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
194.0\439.0\D\3.0\1.121\\you haven't seen the cardiology since June.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
195.0\440.0\P\3.0\2.13\\right\14.0\heart health\\\P\
196.0\441.0\D\3.0\2.4\\That would be why we're there.  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
196.0\442.0\D\3.0\5.3\\What I would like to do is have you check in with him.  Okay? \14.0\heart health\\\R\3.2
196.0\443.0\D\3.0\2.121\\ We'll schedule it, \14.0\heart health\\\R\
196.0\444.0\D\3.0\4.1\\but I think I know I'm putting you through so much, \14.0\heart health\\\R\
196.0\445.0\D\3.0\5.3\\but you know, I want to make sure that your hearts tuned\14.0\heart health\\\R\
197.0\446.0\P\3.0\3.1\\right\14.0\heart health\\\R\
198.0\447.0\D\3.0\5.3\\and your medicines are tuned. \14.0\heart health\\\R\
198.0\448.0\D\1.14\82.0\\The fact that you are still having some pain at times \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\449.0\D\1.14\2.1\\you got, you know, the nitroglycerin is a quick fix, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\450.0\D\3.0\5.3\\but I just want him to sort of review everything \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\451.0\D\1.14\2.1\\because it's been, it's been almost a year now.  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\452.0\D\1.14\2.1\\It's been 10 months since your heart attack \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\453.0\D\3.0\5.3\\and you know where he thinks you ought to be at this point. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
198.0\454.0\D\3.0\6.1\\ So could we do just a schedule?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
199.0\455.0\P\3.0\6.21\\Yeah.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\456.0\D\3.0\3.6\\Ok. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\457.0\D\3.0\2.1\\ I mean, it doesn't have to happen even before the holidays \14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\458.0\D\3.0\2.121\\and it probably won't.  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\459.0\D\1.14\1.12\\But how often would you say you feel chest pain?  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\460.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Is it every day?  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
200.0\461.0\D\1.14\1.12\\A couple times a week?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
201.0\462.0\P\1.14\2.1\\Maybe a couple times a week.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
202.0\463.0\D\1.14\1.121\\So not more than that?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
203.0\464.0\P\1.14\2.13\\That I've actually noticed. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
203.0\465.0\P\1.14\2.1\\ It has been there, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
203.0\466.0\P\1.14\2.3\\but you know, I mean, I'm a person that I can endure pain, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
203.0\467.0\P\1.14\2.1\\but to a degree that it gets me over burdened\14.0\heart health\\\P\
204.0\468.0\D\1.14\3.1\\uh huh\14.0\heart health\\\P\
205.0\469.0\P\1.14\81.0\\that's not the [2w].  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
205.0\470.0\P\1.14\2.1\\That's when I have to pull myself down to the hospital when I had that heart attack \14.0\heart health\\\P\
205.0\471.0\P\1.14\81.0\\because that wasn't over [4w].\14.0\heart health\\\P\
206.0\472.0\D\1.14\3.6\\Right, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
206.0\473.0\D\1.14\2.4\\but I mean, still, if you are having significant change, I would imagine you would be aware of it.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
207.0\474.0\P\1.14\3.1\\Yeah.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
208.0\475.0\D\1.14\2.12\\So if you are aware of it only a couple times a week, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
208.0\476.0\D\1.14\1.121\\but you are telling me you are having some of it right now?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
209.0\477.0\P\1.14\2.4\\But it's not that intense or\14.0\heart health\\\P\
210.0\478.0\D\1.14\2.4\\I don't care if it's intense.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
211.0\479.0\P\1.14\3.6\\Okay, yeah, okay. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
211.0\480.0\P\1.14\2.1\\ I'd say about two or three times a week it comes and goes.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
212.0\481.0\D\1.14\3.6\\Okay, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
212.0\482.0\D\1.14\1.121\\and if you rest, it goes away?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
213.0\483.0\P\1.14\2.1\\Yeah, slow down [3w].\14.0\heart health\\\P\
214.0\484.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Do you wake up with it ever? \14.0\heart health\\\P\
214.0\485.0\D\1.14\1.12\\ Do you awaken from sleep with it?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
215.0\486.0\P\1.14\2.1\\No.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
216.0\487.0\D\1.14\1.12\\How many pillows do you sleep on?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
217.0\488.0\P\1.14\81.0\\Um [6w]\14.0\heart health\\\P\
218.0\489.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Do you sleep on more pillows lately?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\490.0\P\1.14\2.1\\Oh, no, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\491.0\P\1.14\83.0\\pillows, pillows, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\492.0\P\1.14\2.11\\I try not to sleep on anything. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\493.0\P\1.14\2.1\\Maybe one \14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\494.0\P\1.14\2.11\\and I pass on that \14.0\heart health\\\P\
219.0\495.0\P\1.14\2.1\\because I am all the way down the end of it.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
220.0\496.0\D\1.14\1.121\\So the pain, when you get it, is mostly associated with activity?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
221.0\497.0\P\1.14\2.13\\Yes.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
222.0\498.0\D\1.14\1.121\\But  yet, it sounds like you are able to do pretty vigorous activity at sometimes and don't get pain.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
223.0\499.0\P\1.14\2.13\\Right.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
224.0\500.0\D\1.14\1.12\\Cause don't you lift heavy boxes at work?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
225.0\501.0\P\1.14\2.11\\Well, I don't lift them. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
225.0\502.0\P\1.14\2.11\\ I pull them off the conveyor belt \14.0\heart health\\\P\
225.0\503.0\P\1.14\2.11\\and I like drag them up the conveyor belt.\14.0\heart health\\\P\
226.0\504.0\D\1.14\1.121\\You are able to do that without wrestling, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
226.0\505.0\D\1.14\1.121\\without pain?\14.0\heart health\\\P\
227.0\506.0\P\1.14\2.13\\Yes, \14.0\heart health\\\P\
227.0\507.0\P\1.14\2.11\\and then again, sometimes if uh, if the pain is overbearing to me, I'll wait it out [4w]\14.0\heart health\\\P\
228.0\508.0\D\1.14\5.7\\good\14.0\heart health\\\P\
229.0\509.0\P\1.14\2.11\\And get up \14.0\heart health\\\P\
229.0\510.0\P\1.14\2.11\\and then lift it up \14.0\heart health\\\P\
229.0\511.0\P\1.14\2.11\\and go. \14.0\heart health\\\P\
229.0\512.0\P\1.14\2.3\\ Because I can deal with pain, you know.  \14.0\heart health\\\P\
229.0\513.0\P\1.14\2.11\\And when freight comes in we pull it off \14.0\heart health\\\P\

372.0\796.0\P\4.0\2.1\\I think I arrived on [3w] \S\\\\\
372.0\797.0\P\4.0\2.1\\and they put me on the [5w] sit down on the bench, \S\\\\\
372.0\798.0\P\4.0\2.1\\then [2w] came over \S\\\\\

374.0\802.0\P\4.0\2.1\\and then the bus came up \S\\\\\
374.0\803.0\P\4.0\81.0\\and [2w].  \S\\\\\
374.0\804.0\P\4.0\2.12\\That was because we were talking. \S\\\\\

377.0\812.0\D\4.0\2.64\\Oh my god.\S\\\\\

381.0\829.0\D\4.0\2.63\\[laughs]\S\\\\\
382.0\830.0\P\4.0\2.1\\Because when I saw her she was with some guy \S\\\\\
382.0\831.0\P\4.0\2.1\\and he was standing above us doing something \S\\\\\
382.0\832.0\P\4.0\2.1\\and then these people walking by \S\\\\\
382.0\833.0\P\4.0\2.1\\and she knew everybody \S\\\\\
382.0\834.0\P\4.0\82.0\\so that was, \S\\\\\

386.0\849.0\P\4.0\2.11\\we prayed together.\S\\\\\
