75.0\116.0\D\3.0\5.1\and that would be great too, get a nice low cholesterol level back then, your regular\4.0\\\\P\

83.0\127.0\D\1.13\3.3\then we get down to the T cell count.  \5.0\HIV tests\2.1\D\P\
83.0\128.0\D\1.13\2.1\Let's do a trend.  . . . . .\5.0\\\\P\
84.0\129.0\P\1.13\1.121\CD4, uh huh\5.0\\\\P\
85.0\130.0\D\1.13\2.13\yeah. \5.0\\\\P\
85.0\131.0\D\1.13\5.4\ Look at the flow sheet. \5.0\\\\P\
85.0\132.0\D\1.13\2.1\ It goes back to August of '03, \5.0\\\\P\
85.0\133.0\D\1.13\2.1\and then you were in the 200 range\5.0\\\\P\
86.0\134.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\P\
87.0\135.0\D\1.13\2.1\264, \5.0\\\\P\
87.0\136.0\D\1.13\2.4\I think we were just monitoring you back then\5.0\\\\P\
88.0\137.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm I see that\5.0\\\\P\
89.0\138.0\D\1.13\2.1\And you got down to a low of 231 April of '04, \5.0\\\\P\
89.0\139.0\D\1.13\2.1\which is the lowest we have recording of you. \5.0\\\\P\
89.0\140.0\D\1.13\2.4\ And then it looks like, that's probably about the time we resumed treatment\5.0\\\\P\
90.0\141.0\P\1.13\1.121\230.0\5.0\\\\P\
91.0\142.0\D\1.13\2.1\231.0\5.0\\\\P\
92.0\143.0\P\1.13\3.6\ok. \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\144.0\P\1.13\2.1\ And I showed here that, this is uh November 7th of  '05 I had CD4 of 420, \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\145.0\P\1.13\3.2\ok there we go, \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\146.0\P\1.13\2.44\I'm sorry, \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\147.0\P\1.13\2.1\that's November. \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\148.0\P\1.13\2.1\ Okay I had December, \5.0\\\\P\
92.0\149.0\P\1.13\2.1\I just couldn't  get the date on it\5.0\\\\P\
93.0\150.0\D\1.13\2.1\September of '03, 342 \5.0\\\\P\
93.0\151.0\D\1.13\2.1\and April 05, 420\5.0\\\\P\
94.0\152.0\P\1.13\3.6\ok  \5.0\\\\P\
94.0\153.0\P\1.13\2.1\anyway so then we're up to 59\5.0\\\\P\
95.0\154.0\D\1.13\81.0\[3w] \5.0\\\\P\
95.0\155.0\D\1.13\2.1\T cells came down a little.  \5.0\\\\P\
95.0\156.0\D\5.0\2.1\One of the things we found with the combination of the Videx and the Viread\5.0\\\\P\
96.0\157.0\P\5.0\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\158.0\D\5.0\82.0\is that even when we have full viral suppression \5.0\\\\P\
97.0\159.0\D\1.13\2.1\and your last viral load was undetectable \5.0\\\\P\
97.0\160.0\D\1.13\2.1\and it's been undetectable going back a ways, \5.0\\\\P\
97.0\161.0\D\5.0\2.1\um that we see lower . . . than anticipated T cells. . . . . . .  \5.0\\\\P\
97.0\162.0\D\1.13\2.14\So again this is what was happening to your viral load, \5.0\\\\P\
97.0\163.0\D\1.13\2.14\again, you were off of treatment until April of '04\5.0\\\\P\
98.0\164.0\P\1.13\3.1\'04\5.0\\\\P\
99.0\165.0\D\1.13\2.1\that's when the T cells dropped to that low\5.0\\\\P\
100.0\166.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\P\
101.0\167.0\D\1.13\2.1\we started to have really great response, \5.0\\\\P\
101.0\168.0\D\1.13\2.1\viral load dropped down after just a month or two to 530, \5.0\\\\P\
101.0\169.0\D\1.13\2.1\and then you've been undetectable since that time.\5.0\\\\P\
102.0\170.0\P\1.13\3.1\hmm\5.0\\\\P\
103.0\171.0\D\1.13\3.1\Okay?\5.0\\\\P\
104.0\172.0\P\1.13\2.64\That's weird how it's just blank right there huh?\5.0\\\\P\
105.0\173.0\D\1.13\2.1\Well those were ultrasensitive tests\5.0\\\\P\
106.0\174.0\P\1.13\3.1\hm\5.0\\\\P\
107.0\175.0\D\1.13\2.1\and those were less than 50.\5.0\\\\P\
108.0\176.0\P\1.13\2.2\Oh I see,  they\5.0\\\\P\
109.0\177.0\D\1.13\3.1\yeah\5.0\\\\P\
110.0\178.0\P\1.13\11.0\[crosstalk 4w] they ran another step\5.0\\\\P\
111.0\179.0\D\1.13\2.1\They did a different aspect this time.  \5.0\\\\P\
111.0\180.0\D\1.13\2.1\Cuz you've been undetectable, essentially, since you started this regimen. \5.0\\\\P\
111.0\181.0\D\5.2\2.1\ I don't, We don't like to use the combination, though of the Videx and the Viread, \5.0\\\\P\
111.0\182.0\D\5.2\2.1\because of this issue that it seems to kind of keep the CD 4 count\5.0\\\\P\
112.0\183.0\P\5.14\1.12\Which one's Videx?\5.0\\\\P\
113.0\184.0\D\5.14\2.1\That's the DDI, the Didanosine.\5.0\\\\P\
114.0\185.0\P\5.14\1.121\oh this is also called Didanosine\5.0\\\\P\
115.0\186.0\D\5.14\2.13\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
116.0\187.0\P\5.2\3.6\ok, \5.0\\\\I\
116.0\188.0\P\5.2\8.0\go aheah, you were saying\5.0\\\\P\
117.0\189.0\D\5.2\2.1\It tends to keep the T cells down\5.0\\\\P\
118.0\190.0\P\5.2\82.1\the\5.0\\\\P\
119.0\191.0\D\5.2\2.1\even though your virus is fully suppressed, you're getting full viral suppression, \5.0\\\\P\
119.0\192.0\D\5.2\2.1\which is terrific. \5.0\\\\P\
119.0\193.0\D\5.2\2.1\ When we use  those 2 drugs together\5.0\\\\P\
120.0\194.0\P\5.2\3.1\hm\5.0\\\\P\
121.0\195.0\D\5.2\11.0\for reasons that haven't been wellexplained, we can see a gradual drop in CD4 count. \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\196.0\D\5.2\2.1\ And I've seen this in a couple of my patients \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\197.0\D\5.2\2.1\and in some the T cells have even dropped down to you know the 200 range or lower, \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\198.0\D\5.2\2.1\so we've had to get 'em off of it. \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\199.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Your T cells have been uh fairly stable, \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\200.0\D\1.13\3.3\but let's really go back a long ways.  \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\201.0\D\1.13\2.1\Um. . . .So here you were in the 500, 400, 500, \5.0\\\\P\
121.0\202.0\D\1.13\2.1\that's when you were on your former regimen with the Viramune.\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\203.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\P\
123.0\204.0\D\1.13\2.1\And then you came off treatment \5.0\\\\P\
123.0\205.0\D\1.13\2.1\and the T cells, you know, were in this 200 to 300 range.  \5.0\\\\P\
123.0\206.0\D\1.13\2.1\We got down to this level, \5.0\\\\P\
123.0\207.0\D\1.13\2.1\we resumed treatment, \5.0\\\\P\
123.0\208.0\D\1.13\2.1\you started coming up \5.0\\\\P\

125.0\215.0\D\1.18\2.13\Yeah. \5.0\\\\P\
125.0\216.0\D\5.0\2.1\ It's generally recommended, though, that we don't use that combination, \5.0\\\\I\
125.0\217.0\D\5.0\2.1\that we have alternatives. \5.0\\\\I\
125.0\218.0\D\5.0\2.1\ And of course in your situation we have tons of alternatives, so.  \5.0\\\\P\
125.0\219.0\D\3.0\2.43\But you're right, \5.0\\\\P\
125.0\220.0\D\3.0\2.1\the starting point is to see where you are today\5.0\\\\P\

128.0\224.0\P\3.0\3.6\yeah \5.0\\\\R\
128.0\225.0\P\3.0\6.2\I'll just do all that \5.0\\\\R\2.1

134.0\236.0\P\3.0\2.5\and I don't want\5.0\\\\P\
135.0\237.0\D\3.0\2.132\The data affected.\5.0\\\\P\
136.0\238.0\P\3.0\11.0\Any of the results to be skewed \5.0\\\\P\

137.0\240.0\D\3.0\2.66\That's fine. \5.0\\\\P\
137.0\241.0\D\3.0\6.3\So what I can do is put them in um, \5.0\\\\P\

138.0\243.0\P\3.0\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\P\

217.0\380.0\P\1.17\2.4\those are all probably what you're looking for anyway.\8.0\\\\P\
218.0\381.0\D\1.17\1.12\Do you know if you've ever been immunized for hepatitis A?  \8.0\\\\P\

220.0\384.0\D\1.17\2.1\Hepatitis A is the one that you can get from um um being exposed to contaminated food or water, \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\385.0\D\1.17\2.1\so we especially recommend it for people who are traveling like to Mexico.  \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\386.0\D\1.17\2.1\But interestingly there's usually an outbreak of hepatitis A every year in Oregon, \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\387.0\D\1.17\2.1\and it's a really safe vaccine. \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\388.0\D\1.17\2.1\ It's not a live vaccine, \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\389.0\D\1.17\2.1\it's two shots, \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\390.0\D\1.17\2.1\we give one \8.0\\\\I\
220.0\391.0\D\1.17\2.1\and then six months later we give a booster.\8.0\\\\I\
221.0\392.0\P\1.17\3.1\ok\8.0\\\\I\
222.0\393.0\D\1.17\2.1\But even the first vaccine is highly effective in preventing hepatitis A.\8.0\\\\I\
223.0\394.0\P\1.17\3.1\ok\8.0\\\\I\
224.0\395.0\D\1.17\2.1\And that's a twoshot series. \8.0\\\\I\

224.0\397.0\D\1.17\2.1\and we actually recommend it every five years \8.0\\\\I\
