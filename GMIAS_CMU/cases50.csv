72.0\108.0\D\1.16\1.12\ Why not? \2.0\7.0\\\\P\
72.0\109.0\D\1.16\82.0\You\1.0\7.0\\\\P\
73.0\110.0\P\1.16\2.1\Because you gave me the pills, \6.0\7.0\\\\P\
73.0\111.0\P\1.16\2.11\and one day I would take the pills, \8.0\7.0\\\\P\
73.0\112.0\P\1.16\81.0\and then the pills [15w].\5.0\7.0\\\\P\
74.0\113.0\D\1.16\1.12\Okay, now what about Chantix?  \5.0\7.0\\\\P\
74.0\114.0\D\1.16\1.12\Is that something that you had different things before \9.0\7.0\\\\P\
74.0\115.0\D\1.16\1.121\but I don't think you ever had Chantix, right?\9.0\7.0\\\\P\
75.0\116.0\P\1.16\1.122\What's that?\2.0\7.0\\\\P\
76.0\117.0\D\1.16\2.1\You had Zyban, which is Wellbutrin for smoking\8.0\7.0\\\\P\
77.0\118.0\P\1.16\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\7.0\\\\P\
78.0\119.0\D\1.16\2.1\But there is a new medication now that is called Chantix. \11.0\7.0\\\\I\
78.0\120.0\D\1.16\5.1\ I would suggest you don't get it today \8.0\7.0\\\\R\
78.0\121.0\D\1.16\5.1\because it's a very good medication, works really well\9.0\7.0\\\\I\
79.0\122.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
80.0\123.0\D\1.16\5.1\But you kind of have to think about it and be ready\12.0\7.0\\\\R\
81.0\124.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\R\
82.0\125.0\D\1.16\5.3\Because I don't want you to take it\8.0\7.0\\\\R\
83.0\126.0\P\1.16\3.1\yeah\1.0\7.0\\\\R\
84.0\127.0\D\1.16\2.1\and Medicaid is not going to cover it [1w]\9.0\7.0\\\\P\
85.0\128.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay, \1.0\7.0\\\\P\
85.0\129.0\P\1.16\6.1\just let me think about it\6.0\7.0\\\\R\
86.0\130.0\D\1.16\5.3\No no, but I want you to think about it, though\11.0\7.0\\\\R\
87.0\131.0\P\1.16\6.21\All right.\2.0\7.0\\\\R\
88.0\132.0\D\1.16\2.1\Because the way it works is actually a new medication, its' called Chantix, \13.0\7.0\\\\I\
88.0\133.0\D\1.16\2.1\it just came out not so not long ago, \9.0\7.0\\\\I\
88.0\134.0\D\1.16\2.1\and the idea is that it decreases the craving\9.0\7.0\\\\I\
89.0\135.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
90.0\136.0\D\1.16\5.6\And you can use it together with the patch.  \9.0\7.0\\\\I\
90.0\137.0\D\1.16\5.6\You can't use it together with Wellbutrin\7.0\7.0\\\\I\
91.0\138.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
92.0\139.0\D\1.16\2.1\Because they haven't started study them together.\7.0\7.0\\\\I\
93.0\140.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
94.0\141.0\D\1.16\5.6\But with the patch you can use it.  \8.0\7.0\\\\I\
94.0\142.0\D\1.16\2.1\So essentially you kind of build it up, \8.0\7.0\\\\I\
94.0\143.0\D\1.16\2.1\you start with a little pill once a day then you go to twice a day \16.0\7.0\\\\I\
94.0\144.0\D\1.16\2.1\and you get a stronger pill twice a day\9.0\7.0\\\\I\
95.0\145.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
96.0\146.0\D\1.16\2.1\And although it works over about 12 weeks \8.0\7.0\\\\I\
96.0\147.0\D\1.16\2.1\and the results are very good, \6.0\7.0\\\\I\
96.0\148.0\D\1.16\5.5\but it has to be a motivated person, so\9.0\7.0\\\\R\
97.0\149.0\P\1.16\5.5\Okay you have to be really really really really want to do it.\13.0\7.0\\\\R\
98.0\150.0\D\1.16\5.3\I wouldn't want you to, \5.0\7.0\\\\R\
98.0\151.0\D\1.16\5.5\it's not something that you just try, \7.0\7.0\\\\R\
98.0\152.0\D\1.16\1.32\you know what I mean?\5.0\7.0\\\\R\
99.0\153.0\P\1.16\2.2\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\R\
100.0\154.0\D\1.16\5.5\You have to kind of be dedicated to it. \9.0\7.0\\\\R\
100.0\155.0\D\1.16\2.1\ But you know with smoking many people try a few times, doesn't work, \13.0\7.0\\\\I\
100.0\156.0\D\1.16\2.1\then there are those who try, eventually they stop.\9.0\7.0\\\\I\
101.0\157.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\I\
102.0\158.0\D\1.16\5.4\So think about it\4.0\7.0\\\\R\
103.0\159.0\P\1.16\6.21\Okay.\1.0\7.0\\\\R\
104.0\160.0\D\1.16\5.4\So let me know when is a good time for you \11.0\7.0\\\\R\
104.0\161.0\D\1.16\5.4\and you can try them.\5.0\7.0\\\\R\
105.0\162.0\P\1.16\6.21\All right, will do.\4.0\7.0\\\\R\
106.0\163.0\D\1.16\1.31\Okay? \1.0\7.0\\\\R\
106.0\164.0\D\1.16\3.4\okay, \1.0\7.0\\\\R\2.1
