39.0\67.0\D\6.0\3.1\Uhhuh.\\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\68.0\P\6.0\2.61\I can't believe.\\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\69.0\D\6.0\2.1\That's one of the drugs that people do react too. \\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\70.0\D\3.0\2.121\ So I'm going to put right on the front of your chart.\\1.0\\\\R\4.1
42.0\71.0\P\3.0\3.6\ok\\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\72.0\D\6.0\2.63\[chuckles] \\1.0\\\\P\

47.0\80.0\D\6.0\3.1\Uhhuh\\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\81.0\P\6.0\11.0\before I went to bed.\\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\82.0\D\6.0\3.6\right.  Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\83.0\D\1.14\1.121\and so you were coughing a lot?\\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\84.0\P\1.14\2.13\I was still doing it.\\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\85.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\86.0\P\1.14\2.1\See, cause I have a lot of mucus, right here\\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\87.0\D\1.14\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\88.0\P\1.14\2.1\and I just can't get it\\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\89.0\D\1.14\1.12\Do you feel like you have it up on your sinuses?\\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\90.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.\\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\91.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\92.0\D\1.14\1.121\it's not dripping down the back of your throat like when you are lying down in bed \\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\93.0\D\1.14\1.121\and swallowing a lot?\\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\94.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yeah, I'm swallowing it a lot.\\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\95.0\D\1.14\1.121\Because it feels like there is something back there?\\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\96.0\P\1.14\2.13\Umhum, \\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\97.0\P\1.14\2.1\because a lot of times I spit, you know, spit it out.\\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\98.0\D\1.14\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\99.0\P\1.14\2.1\Just out in the middle of the night, just spitting it out\\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\100.0\D\1.14\3.1\Right, right.\\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\101.0\P\1.14\2.4\But there's just too much down there\\1.0\\\\P\
65.0\102.0\D\1.14\3.1\right\\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\103.0\P\1.14\2.2\and I know it's there \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\104.0\P\1.14\2.4\because I can feel it.\\1.0\\\\P\
67.0\105.0\D\1.14\1.121\As you are coughing it up.\\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\106.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right.\\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\107.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay, all right. \\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\108.0\D\3.3\1.12\ And what's your pharmacy coverage now?\\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\109.0\P\3.3\2.1\The same.\\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\110.0\D\3.3\3.1\Um.\\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\111.0\P\3.3\2.1\Yeah, nothing changed.\\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\112.0\D\3.3\2.2\I know, \\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\113.0\D\3.3\2.2\but I don't know what it was last, what it is.\\1.0\\\\P\
74.0\114.0\P\3.3\3.2\Um.\\1.0\\\\P\
75.0\115.0\D\3.3\1.12\Is it uh\\1.0\\\\P\
76.0\116.0\P\3.3\2.1\Whatever it is, they took\\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\117.0\D\3.3\11.0\Medicare D?\\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\118.0\P\3.3\2.1\Umhum.\\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\119.0\D\3.3\1.121\It did pay for that?\\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\120.0\P\3.3\2.13\Yeah.\\1.0\\\\P\
81.0\121.0\D\6.0\5.4\So what we need is to get you, to take the codeine out \\1.0\\\\R\
81.0\122.0\D\6.0\5.4\and put something else with the Robitussin, \\1.0\\\\R\
81.0\123.0\D\6.0\2.1\because what that does is it thins the stuff out.\\1.0\\\\I\
82.0\124.0\P\6.0\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\I\
83.0\125.0\D\1.14\2.1\You've got that thick stuff just sitting there.\\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\126.0\P\1.14\3.1\Right.\\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\127.0\D\1.14\2.1\And we need to thin it out.  \\1.0\\\\R\
85.0\128.0\D\6.0\2.121\Um, so I will do that \\1.0\\\\R\
85.0\129.0\D\6.0\5.1\and you can take it like every six hours, \\1.0\\\\R\
85.0\130.0\D\6.0\5.1\you can take it three or four times in a day\\1.0\\\\R\
86.0\131.0\P\6.0\3.1\uh huh\\1.0\\\\R\
87.0\132.0\D\6.0\2.121\just to thin all that out\\1.0\\\\R\
88.0\133.0\P\6.0\3.1\ok\\1.0\\\\R\2.1
89.0\134.0\D\6.0\82.0\and you might want to, \\1.0\\\\R\
89.0\135.0\D\6.0\5.1\we might want to get you a decongestant too.  \\1.0\\\\R\
89.0\136.0\D\1.14\2.4\Because I think it is.  I think it's almost like a slow ooze, from up here down the back of your throat\\1.0\\\\P\
90.0\137.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\138.0\D\11.0\11.0\down into here. \\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\139.0\D\1.14\2.1\ And you can hear it, \\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\140.0\D\1.14\2.1\I can [2w] right now.  \\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\141.0\D\1.14\2.4\But that's exactly what you feel like  \\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\142.0\D\1.14\2.63\[laughs]\\1.0\\\\P\
92.0\143.0\P\1.14\1.121\Just like they was before Christmas\\1.0\\\\P\
93.0\144.0\D\1.14\2.13\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
94.0\145.0\P\1.14\2.4\and after Christmas, I thought I couldn't take it anymore.\\1.0\\\\P\
95.0\146.0\D\1.14\1.12\Are you having any fever?\\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\147.0\P\6.0\2.11\I bought over the counter, I bought stuff over the counter.  \\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\148.0\P\6.0\2.11\I bought the Tylenol cold pill. \\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\149.0\P\6.0\2.1\ I had Robitussin\\1.0\\\\P\
97.0\150.0\D\6.0\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\151.0\P\1.14\2.1\and it didn't do no good.  \\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\152.0\P\1.14\82.0\I'm just saying, nothing is, \\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\153.0\P\1.14\2.4\it's not good \\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\154.0\P\1.14\2.1\because your nose still runs \\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\155.0\P\6.0\2.5\and I'm saying, something's got to give. \\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\156.0\P\1.14\2.5\ I don't want to be walking around with pneumonia.  No I don't\\1.0\\\\P\
99.0\157.0\D\1.14\3.6\Right, right.  \\1.0\\\\P\
99.0\158.0\D\1.14\1.12\Any fevers at this point?\\1.0\\\\P\
100.0\159.0\P\1.14\2.1\Nope.\\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\160.0\D\1.14\1.12\Any like pressure \\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\161.0\D\1.14\1.12\or pain in this area?\\1.0\\\\P\
102.0\162.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.  Not, not\\1.0\\\\P\
103.0\163.0\D\1.14\1.12\Earaches?\\1.0\\\\P\
104.0\164.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.\\1.0\\\\P\
105.0\165.0\D\1.14\1.12\Sore throat?\\1.0\\\\P\
106.0\166.0\P\1.14\82.0\Just like\\1.0\\\\P\
107.0\167.0\D\1.14\1.121\Just irritated kind of?\\1.0\\\\P\
108.0\168.0\P\1.14\2.13\right\\1.0\\\\P\
109.0\169.0\D\1.14\3.3\And then your coughing \\1.0\\\\P\
109.0\170.0\D\1.14\1.121\and when you cough, you bring some stuff up, or\\1.0\\\\P\
110.0\171.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right. \\1.0\\\\P\
110.0\172.0\P\1.14\2.4\ It's like spit I'm brining up, \\1.0\\\\P\
110.0\173.0\P\1.14\2.4\not mucus.\\1.0\\\\P\
111.0\174.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay, all right.\\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\175.0\P\1.14\2.1\Then I can bring stuff up \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\176.0\P\1.14\2.4\and you can feel like there's a cord down there that's holding it\\1.0\\\\P\
113.0\177.0\D\1.14\3.1\yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
114.0\178.0\P\1.14\11.0\from all that's coming up.\\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\179.0\D\1.14\2.4\But I actually think it's getting better \\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\180.0\D\1.14\2.1\so it is thicker, \\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\181.0\D\1.14\2.1\like earlier it's thinner, \\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\182.0\D\1.14\2.1\but this is the thick stage.\\1.0\\\\P\
116.0\183.0\P\1.14\3.1\Hm\\1.0\\\\P\
117.0\184.0\D\1.14\1.12\Now, um, any shortness of breath? \\1.0\\\\P\
117.0\185.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Do you cough more when you try to do stuff, \\1.0\\\\P\
117.0\186.0\D\1.14\1.12\or is it mostly at night?\\1.0\\\\P\
118.0\187.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's during the day, \\1.0\\\\P\
118.0\188.0\P\1.14\82.0\night, you know.\\1.0\\\\P\
119.0\189.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay, all right. \\1.0\\\\P\
119.0\190.0\D\6.0\1.12\ And do you have any Claritin \\1.0\\\\P\
119.0\191.0\D\6.0\1.12\or Loratadine at home?\\1.0\\\\P\
120.0\192.0\P\6.0\1.122\What is that?\\1.0\\\\P\
121.0\193.0\D\6.0\2.1\It's something that helps stop makes so much mucus.\\1.0\\\\P\
122.0\194.0\P\6.0\2.1\No.\\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\195.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\196.0\D\6.0\2.121\I'm going to write you for the Robitussin DM, \\1.0\\\\R\
123.0\197.0\D\6.0\2.1\and that helps stop the cough \\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\198.0\D\6.0\2.1\and it also um thins it out.\\1.0\\\\I\
124.0\199.0\P\6.0\3.1\Umhum.\\1.0\\\\I\
125.0\200.0\D\6.0\2.1\That's just a liquid. . . . . . \\1.0\\\\I\
125.0\201.0\D\6.0\3.2\Okay, \\1.0\\\\I\
125.0\202.0\D\6.0\2.121\and with a refill on it if it keeps going. \\1.0\\\\R\4.1
125.0\203.0\D\6.0\2.1\ And then Loratadine helps stop making the mucus.\\1.0\\\\I\
126.0\204.0\P\6.0\5.4\Give me some Motrin's too.\\1.0\\\\R\
127.0\205.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay.\\1.0\\\\R\4.1
128.0\206.0\P\6.0\1.121\Which kind, 800?\\1.0\\\\R\
129.0\207.0\D\6.0\2.13\Uhhuh. \\1.0\\\\R\

130.0\209.0\P\6.0\81.0\You got that [4w] too, but the last time.\\1.0\\\\R\
131.0\210.0\D\6.0\2.121\It will make your throat feel better.\\1.0\\\\R\
132.0\211.0\P\6.0\3.6\Uhhuh, \\1.0\\\\R\
132.0\212.0\P\6.0\2.1\because last time I had something like that I was taking Motrin\\1.0\\\\P\
133.0\213.0\D\6.0\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\214.0\P\6.0\2.1\and whatever it is Motrin 800 mg \\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\215.0\P\6.0\2.1\and it was broken up \\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\216.0\P\6.0\2.1\and I would bring it off.  \\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\217.0\P\4.0\1.11\So how was your Christmas?  \\S\\\\\
134.0\218.0\P\4.0\2.14\You didn't talk about your Christmas.\\S\\\\\

138.0\230.0\P\4.0\2.11\Really, after this cold, I didn't do anything.\\S\\\\\
139.0\231.0\D\4.0\3.1\mhm\\S\\\\\
140.0\232.0\P\4.0\2.11\I mean, the day before Christmas I went to bed feeling good, \\S\\\\\

141.0\234.0\D\4.0\3.1\mhm\\S\\\\\
142.0\235.0\P\1.14\2.1\and when I woke up the 24th, that's when my nose \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\236.0\P\1.14\2.1\and stuff started running.  \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\237.0\P\1.14\2.4\They 25th, I couldn't do anything \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\238.0\P\1.14\2.4\because I mean, I was really out of it. \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\239.0\P\1.14\2.11\ So the 25th, I said, wait a minute. \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\240.0\P\1.14\2.51\ We are going to stop the press right here, right now. \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\241.0\P\3.0\2.51\ I'm going straight down to [name] \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\242.0\P\3.0\2.51\some body is gonna see me \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\243.0\P\3.0\2.51\and do something\\1.0\\\\P\
143.0\244.0\D\3.0\3.1\mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
144.0\245.0\P\3.0\11.0\right then and there.  \\1.0\\\\P\
144.0\246.0\P\3.0\2.11\And I did.\\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\247.0\D\3.0\3.1\uh huh\\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\248.0\P\6.0\2.1\And they gave me something \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\249.0\P\6.0\82.0\and I, \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\250.0\P\6.0\2.1\they said do you have a problem with something with Codeine in it \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\251.0\P\6.0\2.11\and I said, no, I don't have a problem.\\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\252.0\D\6.0\3.6\Right, \\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\253.0\D\6.0\1.121\probably because you've never had it.\\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\254.0\P\6.0\2.13\I've never had it.  \\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\255.0\P\6.0\2.62\So when I got it I said, oh my god, I just never felt ever again.  \\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\256.0\P\6.0\2.5\I wouldn't even give it to my worst enemy.  \\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\257.0\P\6.0\2.63\[chuckles]\\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\258.0\D\6.0\3.6\Oh, okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\259.0\D\5.1\1.11\so what's happened with the HIV meds \\2.0\HIV meds\4.11\D\P\
149.0\260.0\D\5.1\1.121\so you've been able to keep taking them through all this?\\2.0\\\\P\
150.0\261.0\P\5.12\2.11\Oh yeah.  \\2.0\\\\P\
150.0\262.0\P\5.12\2.5\I'm not going to let them slide.  \\2.0\\\\P\
150.0\263.0\P\5.12\82.0\I'm not going to let, \\2.0\\\\P\
150.0\264.0\P\5.11\2.11\I have missed it one time.\\2.0\\\\P\
151.0\265.0\D\5.11\3.1\mhm\\2.0\\\\P\
152.0\266.0\P\5.11\2.11\Just that one.\\2.0\\\\P\
153.0\267.0\D\5.11\3.1\Okay.\\2.0\\\\P\
154.0\268.0\P\5.118\2.1\That was because for several reasons \\2.0\\\\P\
154.0\269.0\P\5.118\2.11\I missed that because I was taking that over the counter stuff.\\2.0\\\\P\
155.0\270.0\D\5.118\3.1\uh huh\\2.0\\\\P\
156.0\271.0\P\5.118\2.51\And I didn't want to cross represent what, \\2.0\\\\P\
156.0\272.0\P\6.0\2.1\but I was taking like the Robitussin \\2.0\\\\P\
156.0\273.0\P\6.0\2.1\and the Tylenol \\2.0\\\\P\
156.0\274.0\P\6.0\2.1\and this and that.\\2.0\\\\P\
157.0\275.0\D\5.4\5.6\It's actually, it's okay for that, all the cold medicines you can take with it.\\2.0\\\\P\
158.0\276.0\P\5.4\3.6\Oh, okay.\\2.0\\\\P\
159.0\277.0\D\5.4\2.121\Just for the future you know.\\2.0\\\\P\
160.0\278.0\P\5.4\3.6\Umhum, \\2.0\\\\P\
160.0\279.0\P\5.11\2.11\but only that one day, \\2.0\\\\P\
160.0\280.0\P\5.11\2.11\because one day I didn't, \\2.0\\\\P\
160.0\281.0\P\5.11\2.2\I just remember, back when I told them I missed it one time\\2.0\\\\P\
161.0\282.0\D\5.11\3.1\uh huh\\2.0\\\\P\
162.0\283.0\P\5.12\2.11\but other than that, I didn't miss no more.\\2.0\\\\P\5.0
163.0\284.0\D\1.13\2.14\Well, you had your last draw on a day you were sick \\3.0\test results\4.22\D\P\
163.0\285.0\D\1.13\2.1\and your HIV labs look great.\\3.0\\\\P\
164.0\286.0\P\1.13\2.5\That's what I want to know.\\3.0\\\\P\
165.0\287.0\D\1.13\2.1\So despite the cold.   Your CD4 count um was 236, \\3.0\\\\P\
165.0\288.0\D\1.13\2.1\which is a little lower than it was last time, \\3.0\\\\P\
165.0\289.0\D\1.13\2.4\but if you were right smack in the middle of a cold, that's just fine by me \\3.0\\\\P\
165.0\290.0\D\1.13\2.1\because the virus was undetectable.\\3.0\\\\P\
166.0\291.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\\3.0\\\\P\
167.0\292.0\D\1.13\2.4\So everything was just fine \\3.0\\\\P\
167.0\293.0\D\1.13\2.1\and actually your percent CD4 went up \\3.0\\\\P\
167.0\294.0\D\1.13\2.12\which just means that likely your immune system is continuing to improve on the medication. \\3.0\\\\P\5.0
167.0\295.0\D\5.2\1.11\ So, any troubles with the Epzicom \\4.0\side effects\3.1\D\P\

170.0\301.0\P\1.15\1.121\My cholesterol.\\6.0\\\\P\
171.0\302.0\D\1.15\2.13\Oh, yep, \\6.0\\\\P\
171.0\303.0\D\1.15\2.1\it looks all right. \\6.0\\\\R\
171.0\304.0\D\1.15\2.1\ Your total cholesterol is 210.\\6.0\\\\R\1.12
172.0\305.0\P\1.15\1.12\Is that the good side or the bad side?\\6.0\\\\P\
173.0\306.0\D\1.15\2.1\That's the total. \\6.0\\\\P\
173.0\307.0\D\1.15\2.1\ You want it around 200 or less.\\6.0\\\\I\
174.0\308.0\P\1.15\3.1\Okay.\\6.0\\\\I\
175.0\309.0\D\1.15\2.4\So, we'll accept that one.  That's okay. \\6.0\\\\P\
175.0\310.0\D\1.15\2.1\ Um and then your triglycerides, you want under 100 \\6.0\\\\R\
175.0\311.0\D\1.15\82.0\and they are, \\6.0\\\\I\
175.0\312.0\D\1.15\2.1\oh, you want under 150 \\6.0\\\\I\
175.0\313.0\D\1.15\2.1\and they are 106\\6.0\\\\R\
176.0\314.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\\6.0\\\\R\
177.0\315.0\D\1.15\2.1\and your good cholesterol \\6.0\\\\R\
177.0\316.0\D\1.15\2.1\that protects your heart \\6.0\\\\I\
177.0\317.0\D\1.15\11.0\was high, \\6.0\\\\R\
177.0\318.0\D\1.15\2.4\especially for a man.\\6.0\\\\R\
178.0\319.0\P\1.15\1.121\That's high?\\6.0\\\\P\
179.0\320.0\D\1.15\2.1\51, \\6.0\\\\P\
179.0\321.0\D\1.15\2.1\that's good.\\6.0\\\\P\
180.0\322.0\P\1.15\1.121\You need it to be low?\\6.0\\\\I\
181.0\323.0\D\1.15\2.1\That, so you want that one to be high.\\6.0\\\\I\
182.0\324.0\P\1.15\3.6\Oh, okay.\\6.0\\\\I\
183.0\325.0\D\1.15\2.1\And then your LDL is your bad cholesterol \\6.0\\\\I\
183.0\326.0\D\1.15\2.1\and that's 138\\6.0\\\\R\
184.0\327.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\\6.0\\\\R\
185.0\328.0\D\1.15\2.1\and that is, is actually okay. \\6.0\\\\R\
185.0\329.0\D\1.15\2.1\It kind of depends on the person for that one, \\6.0\\\\I\
185.0\330.0\D\82.0\82.0\so if you, \\6.0\\\\P\
185.0\331.0\D\1.0\1.12\what's your age?\\6.0\\\\P\
186.0\332.0\P\1.0\2.1\49.0\\6.0\\\\P\

192.0\341.0\P\1.16\2.63\[laughs] \\7.0\\\\P\
192.0\342.0\P\1.16\2.11\A lot.\\7.0\\\\P\
193.0\343.0\D\1.16\2.131\A lot, \\7.0\\\\P\
193.0\344.0\D\1.16\3.6\okay.\\7.0\\\\P\
194.0\345.0\P\1.16\2.11\You know, I just picked up smoking more than cigarettes\\7.0\\\\P\
195.0\346.0\D\1.16\3.1\mhm\\7.0\\\\P\
196.0\347.0\P\1.16\5.2\but I need something to stop me from smoking\\7.0\\\\P\
197.0\348.0\D\1.16\3.1\mhm\\7.0\\\\P\
198.0\349.0\P\1.16\2.61\very hard to do. \\7.0\\\\P\
198.0\350.0\P\1.16\2.4\ And you just can't do it on your own.\\7.0\\\\P\
199.0\351.0\D\1.16\2.43\No, \\7.0\\\\P\
199.0\352.0\D\1.16\2.1\now I had a lady in today \\7.0\\\\R\
199.0\353.0\D\1.16\2.1\and she quit. \\7.0\\\\R\
199.0\354.0\D\1.16\2.1\ And she enrolled in a smoke ending class.  \\7.0\\\\R\
199.0\355.0\D\6.0\2.1\She tried the patches before \\7.0\\\\R\
199.0\356.0\D\6.0\2.1\and that didn't work.\\7.0\\\\R\
200.0\357.0\P\6.0\2.11\I never tried the patch.\\7.0\\\\P\
201.0\358.0\D\1.16\2.1\She enrolled in a class, \\7.0\\\\R\
201.0\359.0\D\1.16\2.1\in fact, her insurance said she had to take the class in order to get the patches, \\7.0\\\\R\
201.0\360.0\D\1.16\2.1\but she said she's having such good luck, \\7.0\\\\R\
201.0\361.0\D\6.0\2.1\she might not use the patches.\\7.0\\\\R\
202.0\362.0\P\6.0\3.1\Umhum.\\7.0\\\\R\
203.0\363.0\D\82.0\82.0\I don't, \\7.0\\\\R\
203.0\364.0\D\1.16\2.1\they used to have lists up of where the smoke classes are, \\7.0\\\\R\
203.0\365.0\D\1.16\2.1\um, usually like YMCA's have them. \\7.0\\\\R\
203.0\366.0\D\1.16\2.1\ Community centers have them.\\7.0\\\\R\1.3
204.0\367.0\P\1.16\2.11\I got to the Y, \\7.0\\\\P\
204.0\368.0\P\1.16\2.11\I do exercise now.\\7.0\\\\P\
205.0\369.0\D\1.16\1.122\Oh, you do?\\7.0\\\\P\
206.0\370.0\P\1.16\2.11\Umhum.  \\7.0\\\\P\
206.0\371.0\P\3.0\2.1\[Name of Place].\\7.0\\\\P\
207.0\372.0\D\1.16\2.65\Oh great, \\7.0\\\\P\
207.0\373.0\D\1.16\5.2\can you ask them if they have a smoke ending class?\\7.0\\\\R\
208.0\374.0\P\1.16\6.21\I sure will.\\7.0\\\\R\2.1
209.0\375.0\D\1.16\5.4\Ask them about that, \\7.0\\\\R\
209.0\376.0\D\1.16\5.1\see if that's something that you can do if your interested. \\7.0\\\\R\
209.0\377.0\D\1.16\5.4\ Give it a shot.\\7.0\\\\R\
210.0\378.0\P\1.16\6.21\mhm\\7.0\\\\R\
211.0\379.0\D\1.16\3.2\Um, \\7.0\\\\R\
211.0\380.0\D\1.16\5.1\I would give that a try \\7.0\\\\R\
211.0\381.0\D\6.0\5.4\and then if you want to think about doing the patches, let me know. \\7.0\\\\R\
211.0\382.0\D\1.16\2.12\ They may say just try the class.\\7.0\\\\R\
212.0\383.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\7.0\\\\R\
213.0\384.0\D\6.0\1.21\How do you feel, would you like to try the patches?\\7.0\\\\R\
214.0\385.0\P\6.0\2.5\Well, we'll try the patches \\7.0\\\\R\
214.0\386.0\P\6.0\2.4\because I think the patches work properly.\\7.0\\\\I\
215.0\387.0\D\1.16\5.1\But what I would do though is I wouldn't do the patches till I have started in the class \\7.0\\\\R\
215.0\388.0\D\1.16\82.1\because whenever they have tried to research how, the best way for people to\\7.0\\\\I\
216.0\389.0\P\6.0\2.5\Yeah, if I do the patches\\7.0\\\\R\
217.0\390.0\D\6.0\2.13\mhm\\7.0\\\\R\
218.0\391.0\P\1.16\11.0\I'm not going to no class \\7.0\\\\R\
218.0\392.0\P\1.16\2.2\because I know I'm going to stop.\\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\393.0\D\1.16\3.2\Well, \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\394.0\D\1.16\6.1\let me just tell you, \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\395.0\D\1.16\6.1\let me finish this \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\396.0\D\1.16\5.4\because think about this, \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\397.0\D\1.16\2.1\um, they did a study to see who was best able to quit \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\398.0\D\1.16\2.1\and they found out that people who use the patch \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\399.0\D\1.16\2.1\or the gum \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\400.0\D\1.16\2.1\or there is some pills \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\401.0\D\1.16\2.1\like pills that are usually used for depression, \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\402.0\D\1.16\2.1\but you can use them to try to stop smoking, \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\403.0\D\1.16\2.1\they all had a higher chance of quitting if they also took the class with it.  \\7.0\\\\R\
219.0\404.0\D\1.16\2.1\And the reason that they think that's the case is because the patch takes away the craving\\7.0\\\\R\
220.0\405.0\P\1.16\3.1\mhm\\7.0\\\\R\
221.0\406.0\D\1.16\11.0\the physical craving, \\7.0\\\\R\
221.0\407.0\D\1.16\2.1\but smoking is more than physical. \\7.0\\\\R\
221.0\408.0\D\1.16\2.1\ Smoking has, becomes part of your life\\7.0\\\\R\
222.0\409.0\P\1.16\3.1\right\\7.0\\\\R\
223.0\410.0\D\1.16\2.1\so there are all these what they call cues. \\7.0\\\\R\
223.0\411.0\D\1.16\2.1\ All these things that trigger you to want to have a cigarette, \\7.0\\\\R\
223.0\412.0\D\1.16\2.1\so the class actually helps you like almost think ahead. \\7.0\\\\R\
223.0\413.0\D\1.16\2.1\ And plan like, oh, well am I really going to want that cigarette \\7.0\\\\R\
223.0\414.0\D\1.16\2.1\and what am I doing to do if I don't have a cigarette \\7.0\\\\R\
