33.0\43.0\D\1.13\2.1\637 Tcell count.\\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\44.0\P\1.13\2.3\I never talked to you.\\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\45.0\D\1.13\2.431\Yeah, look.\\1.0\\\\P\

46.0\58.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\59.0\D\1.13\3.2\I put it in there for, \\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\60.0\D\1.13\2.11\I'm printing it for you so you could see the difference.\\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\61.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\62.0\D\1.13\2.11\I'm doing it like we usually do in the graph.\\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\63.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ah.\\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\64.0\D\1.13\11.0\So you can see.\\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\65.0\P\1.13\6.12\Ok, now now we gotta find out what we gonna do about me.\\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\66.0\D\1.13\2.1\Ok, this is the last Tcell.\\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\67.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok\\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\68.0\D\1.13\2.1\637.0\\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\69.0\D\1.13\1.121\So you could see, well those are the ones that are plotted right?\\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\70.0\P\1.13\2.13\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\71.0\D\1.13\2.1\There are some of them like in 2005 that's not in there that was from [name of lab]\\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\72.0\P\1.13\3.1\Uh huh\\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\73.0\D\1.13\11.0\That I didn't put in the computer, \\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\74.0\D\1.13\2.11\but these are the ones that I plotted that I put in once I got it from [name of lab].\\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\75.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\76.0\D\1.13\1.32\So the last level that I got was 637, ok?\\1.0\\\\R\
62.0\77.0\P\1.13\2.2\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\78.0\D\1.13\2.1\That's the Tcells. \\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\79.0\D\1.13\1.32\And you could see the difference, ok? \\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\80.0\D\1.13\2.4\ Not bad at all \\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\81.0\D\1.13\2.1\and your viral load was 23,672. . . . \\1.0\\\\R\1.12
63.0\82.0\D\1.13\2.1\And that has gone down from about two years ago.\\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\83.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
65.0\84.0\D\1.13\1.21\So how do you feel about that?\\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\85.0\P\1.13\3.2\I, well 'cause I really -\\1.0\\\\P\
67.0\86.0\D\1.13\5.6\You could keep that.\\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\87.0\P\1.13\2.4\I'm not really good on these things.\\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\88.0\D\1.13\5.6\You could keep this.\\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\89.0\P\1.13\2.4\Ok, I'm alright. \\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\90.0\P\1.13\2.66\Which is the good -\\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\91.0\D\1.13\5.5\But you wanna talk to your wife I'm sure.\\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\92.0\P\1.13\3.2\Which isâ€¦ \\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\93.0\P\1.13\2.121\yes, she's gonna discuss this with me anyway\\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\94.0\D\1.13\3.6\Ok. \\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\95.0\D\1.13\2.1\So you want your viral load to always go down.\\1.0\\\\I\
74.0\96.0\P\1.13\1.122\Viral load?\\1.0\\\\I\
75.0\97.0\D\1.13\2.1\Viral load.\\1.0\\\\I\
76.0\98.0\P\1.13\2.1\We want this to go down.\\1.0\\\\I\
77.0\99.0\D\1.13\1.31\So see?  \\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\100.0\D\1.13\2.1\Look, it says viral load PCR. \\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\101.0\D\1.13\2.1\That's your viral load.\\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\102.0\P\1.13\1.12\So this is good?\\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\103.0\D\1.13\2.13\That's right. \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\104.0\D\1.13\2.1\Although in 2003 you were only 76. \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\105.0\D\1.13\2.1\That was better. \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\106.0\D\1.13\2.1\So what we're shooting for is a number like this \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\107.0\D\1.13\2.1\or something like 50. \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\108.0\D\1.13\2.1\So this is the best.\\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\109.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
81.0\110.0\D\1.13\82.0\Number you could be -\\1.0\\\\P\
82.0\111.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\112.0\D\1.13\2.1\This is better \\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\113.0\D\1.13\2.1\and you had this in 2003.\\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\114.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\115.0\D\1.13\5.4\So write down, now you want . . down. \\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\116.0\D\1.13\2.1\We want it always to go down.\\1.0\\\\P\
86.0\117.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
87.0\118.0\D\1.13\3.6\Ok. \\1.0\\\\P\
87.0\119.0\D\1.13\82.1\Now you always want your CD4 count -\\1.0\\\\I\
88.0\120.0\P\1.13\2.132\To go up.\\1.0\\\\I\
89.0\121.0\D\1.13\2.131\To go up, \\1.0\\\\I\
89.0\122.0\D\1.13\1.32\but still this is a good number, right?\\1.0\\\\P\
90.0\123.0\P\1.13\2.2\Ok.\\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\124.0\D\1.13\2.1\A bad number would be 200 or lower.\\1.0\\\\I\
92.0\125.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
93.0\126.0\D\1.13\2.1\Because if you're 200 and lower, that will be considered you have AIDS -\\1.0\\\\I\
94.0\127.0\P\1.13\2.4\I gotta keep these charts for myself.\\1.0\\\\P\
95.0\128.0\D\1.13\2.43\That's what I'm saying. \\1.0\\\\P\
95.0\129.0\D\1.13\2.1\They're here for you-\\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\130.0\P\4.0\2.1\'Cause [name of his Wife]  with charts and things. \\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\131.0\P\4.0\2.2\She's not good with paperwork. \\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\132.0\P\4.0\2.1\'Cause pap, my paperwork is all over the house.\\1.0\\\\P\
97.0\133.0\D\4.0\2.63\[chuckles]\\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\134.0\P\4.0\2.1\Hers is tucked away in a drawer. Ya' know .\\1.0\\\\P\
99.0\135.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mhmm\\1.0\\\\P\
100.0\136.0\P\4.0\1.11\What I'm sayin'?\\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\137.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mhmm\\1.0\\\\P\
102.0\138.0\P\4.0\2.4\I like to see my paperwork.\\1.0\\\\P\
103.0\139.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
104.0\140.0\P\4.0\2.51\and I had to find my dental card today.\\1.0\\\\P\
105.0\141.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
106.0\142.0\P\4.0\2.2\But I thought it was my Medicaid card.\\1.0\\\\P\
107.0\143.0\D\4.0\2.63\[Chuckles] \\1.0\\\\P\
107.0\144.0\D\4.0\2.1\ So that that's what it is. \\1.0\\\\P\
107.0\145.0\D\1.13\2.1\Your CD4 count represents your immunity.\\1.0\\\\I\
108.0\146.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
109.0\147.0\D\1.13\2.1\Your immune system. \\1.0\\\\I\
109.0\148.0\D\1.13\2.1\How is your immune system working. \\1.0\\\\I\
109.0\149.0\D\1.13\2.1\Is it holding on?\\1.0\\\\I\
110.0\150.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
111.0\151.0\D\1.13\2.14\Ya' know like we just talked about in the group?\\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\152.0\P\1.13\82.0\In there.\\1.0\\\\P\
113.0\153.0\D\1.13\2.1\Like uh there are certain vaccine if we give you, if your immune system is not good -\\1.0\\\\I\
114.0\154.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
115.0\155.0\D\1.13\2.1\You don't, you don't take, you don't build up an antibody. \\1.0\\\\I\
115.0\156.0\D\1.13\2.1\So because this represents your immune system, therefore you always want it to be up.\\1.0\\\\I\
116.0\157.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\158.0\D\1.13\11.0\Above 200 because anything 200 or less is considered AIDS.\\1.0\\\\I\
118.0\159.0\P\1.13\2.2\Mhmm, ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\160.0\D\1.13\1.31\Alright? \\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\161.0\D\1.13\2.11\ And I wrote that down here for you.\\1.0\\\\P\
120.0\162.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok\\1.0\\\\P\
121.0\163.0\D\1.13\1.12\The viral load . . right?  \\1.0\\\\P\
121.0\164.0\D\1.13\6.2\I'm gonna write it down for you. \\1.0\\\\P\
121.0\165.0\D\1.13\82.0\Viral load . . that represent\\1.0\\\\P\
122.0\166.0\P\1.13\1.12\When I met you it was this?\\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\167.0\D\1.13\2.13\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
124.0\168.0\P\1.13\2.1\70.0\\1.0\\\\P\
125.0\169.0\D\1.13\2.1\Mhmm, 2003.\\1.0\\\\P\
126.0\170.0\P\1.13\2.64\Wow! \\1.0\\\\P\
126.0\171.0\P\1.13\2.2\ I didn't know that.\\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\172.0\D\1.13\1.32\Yeah, but you've been on and off of your meds too. Remember? \\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\173.0\D\5.11\2.1\ There were times you don't take it \\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\174.0\D\5.11\11.0\and you skip.\\1.0\\\\P\
128.0\175.0\P\5.0\2.2\Uh huh.\\1.0\\\\P\
129.0\176.0\D\5.0\2.1\Now the thing is that's how people develop resistance. \\1.0\\\\I\
129.0\177.0\D\5.0\2.1\That's why at times we have to change people's medication.\\1.0\\\\I\
130.0\178.0\P\5.0\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
131.0\179.0\D\1.13\82.1\Now viral load, it represents how much HIV virus -\\1.0\\\\I\
132.0\180.0\P\1.13\2.132\In the system.\\1.0\\\\I\
133.0\181.0\D\1.13\2.131\In the system. . . . \\1.0\\\\I\
133.0\182.0\D\1.13\11.0\Really in your body.\\1.0\\\\I\
134.0\183.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\184.0\D\1.13\2.1\So the higher the viral load.\\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\185.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm\\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\186.0\D\1.13\11.0\The higher you have viruses running in your system.\\1.0\\\\I\
138.0\187.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
139.0\188.0\D\1.13\11.0\That can cause damage.\\1.0\\\\I\
140.0\189.0\P\1.13\2.2\Oh, ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\190.0\D\1.13\2.1\That's why it's recommended for us to keep the viral load below.\\1.0\\\\I\
142.0\191.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
143.0\192.0\D\1.13\2.1\Whereas your immunity, you want that to be high.\\1.0\\\\I\
144.0\193.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhmm.\\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\194.0\D\1.13\1.31\Ok?  \\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\195.0\D\1.13\2.1\That's what it represents CD4 count.\\1.0\\\\I\
146.0\196.0\P\1.13\2.2\Ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
147.0\197.0\D\1.13\1.32\Ok?\\1.0\\\\I\
148.0\198.0\P\1.13\2.2\Ok.\\1.0\\\\I\
149.0\199.0\D\1.13\2.121\So as you keep on getting into to [name of lab] although they're not showing here, \\2.0\lab\2.1\D\P\
149.0\200.0\D\1.13\2.121\I'm gonna keep on fighting them for you.\\2.0\\\\P\

151.0\203.0\D\2.9\1.11\What are we doing?\\2.0\\\\P\
152.0\204.0\P\2.9\2.1\We're, we're goin' through somebody else \\2.0\\\\P\
152.0\205.0\P\2.9\2.69\and I don't know who the hell we're goin' through.\\2.0\\\\P\
153.0\206.0\D\2.9\1.122\I thought, mm, we're not goin' through [name of lab] in terms of what?  \\2.0\\\\P\
153.0\207.0\D\2.9\1.122\In terms of blood work?\\2.0\\\\P\
154.0\208.0\P\2.9\2.13\Yeah.\\2.0\\\\P\
155.0\209.0\D\2.9\1.12\Where are we goin'? \\2.0\\\\P\
