16.0\16.0\D\1.14\3.3\Okay.  Good news.  \3.0\1.0\kidney stone\4.21\D\R\
16.0\17.0\D\1.14\2.2\I think I know what's causing your problem. \8.0\1.0\\\\R\
16.0\18.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Have you had any more fever at all?\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
17.0\19.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
18.0\20.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
19.0\21.0\P\1.14\2.1\I noticed my temperature has been the same 98.3.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
20.0\22.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
21.0\23.0\P\6.0\2.11\And I've been taking the Cipro.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
22.0\24.0\D\6.0\2.131\You're taking the Cipro.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
22.0\25.0\D\6.0\1.12\Remind me how much we called in for you? \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
22.0\26.0\D\6.0\1.121\ Do you remember, was it 500 twice a day?\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\27.0\P\6.0\2.13\It's twice a day, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\28.0\P\6.0\2.2\but I don't remember the strength.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\29.0\D\6.0\2.2\I'm pretty sure it was 500. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\30.0\D\6.0\1.121\ And we were just doing a week, I think, at that point.\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\31.0\P\6.0\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\32.0\P\6.0\2.121\ I've got two more days after today.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\33.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\34.0\D\1.15\2.1\cuz they called about the CT, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\35.0\D\1.15\2.1\and it shows your kidney \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\36.0\D\1.15\2.4\and probably what we think is a stone. \8.0\1.0\\\\R\
26.0\37.0\D\1.15\82.0\ And I did, \3.0\1.0\\\\R\1.1
26.0\38.0\D\1.15\2.1\a radiologist called me, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\39.0\D\1.15\2.4\which I really appreciated, actually, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\40.0\D\1.15\2.11\cuz  What's going on?   I said, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\41.0\D\1.15\2.1\ Well, she's got a little, I think a little urine check \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\42.0\D\1.15\2.1\make sure it's Okay, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\43.0\D\1.15\2.4\this makes sense,  \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\44.0\D\1.15\2.1\cuz she think she sees a stone in your urine, \10.0\1.0\\\\R\
26.0\45.0\D\1.15\2.1\cuz it drains out of your kidney.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\46.0\D\1.15\2.1\And they want to get you right down \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\47.0\D\1.15\2.1\and do another study to prove this, basically. \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\48.0\D\1.15\5.1\ So I think that's what we should do just after this.  \11.0\1.0\\\\R\
26.0\49.0\D\1.15\2.1\And it's a little bit dilated, \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
26.0\50.0\D\1.15\2.1\like it's a little backed up here. \7.0\1.0\\\\R\
26.0\51.0\D\1.14\2.1\ And whenever you get that, it's like a cesspool, in a way, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
26.0\52.0\D\1.14\2.1\that it can get infected.  \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
26.0\53.0\D\1.14\2.1\It's not unusual when you don't have that urine flowing normally.\11.0\1.0\\\\I\
27.0\54.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\55.0\D\1.14\2.12\So what I think is going on is you probably had a little stone on there, \16.0\1.0\\\\R\
28.0\56.0\D\1.14\2.12\and it got infected with this E. coli \8.0\1.0\\\\R\
28.0\57.0\D\1.14\2.12\and it probably gets better \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\58.0\D\1.14\2.12\and then it gets worse. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\59.0\D\1.14\2.12\ And that's why you had this, \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
28.0\60.0\D\1.14\2.1\because it's not usual to do that.  \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\61.0\D\1.14\2.1\Now usually you'll have pain when you have this, okay, \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\62.0\D\1.14\2.1\and the pain is usually back here \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\63.0\D\1.14\2.1\or here \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\64.0\D\1.14\2.1\or both.\2.0\1.0\\\\I\
29.0\65.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
30.0\66.0\D\1.14\2.1\And I believe it was on the left.  \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\67.0\D\1.14\2.14\No pain there. \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\68.0\D\1.14\2.14\ Not a crampy kind of buckling over \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\69.0\D\1.14\2.4\and this is mild fevers.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\70.0\P\1.14\82.0\And I noticed that um since I've been taking the Cipro, there's been \13.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\71.0\P\1.14\2.1\no, like a while back, um my urine was like darker \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\72.0\P\1.14\2.1\and more strongsmelling.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\73.0\D\1.14\3.1\Uh huh\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\74.0\P\1.14\2.1\And I was having to go a lot more often.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\75.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\76.0\P\1.14\2.1\And now it's just like back to normal.  \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\77.0\P\1.14\2.1\I'm not waking up in the middle of the night, \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\78.0\P\1.14\2.4\everything seems to be fine.  \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\79.0\P\1.14\2.1\I'm, you know\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
36.0\80.0\D\1.14\2.65\very good then\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\81.0\P\11.0\11.0\color \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\82.0\P\1.14\2.4\and it's like just, you know, better.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
38.0\83.0\D\1.14\3.1\All right\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\84.0\P\1.14\2.1\No fever, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\85.0\P\1.14\2.1\no weirdness.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\86.0\D\1.14\2.12\Well that's probably what it is, \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
40.0\87.0\D\1.14\2.5\and I just want to make sure we get rid of this once and for all. \16.0\1.0\\\\R\
40.0\88.0\D\6.0\2.1\ And if it gets up into your kidney, lot of times they like to treat you for like ten to fourteen days. \22.0\1.0\\\\R\
40.0\89.0\D\6.0\2.1\ And because of the chronicity of this, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\90.0\D\6.0\5.1\[name of patient], I think we ought to go for the full two weeks. \14.0\1.0\\\\R\
40.0\91.0\D\6.0\5.1\ And even even a slightly higher dose, \7.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
40.0\92.0\D\1.14\2.5\cuz I don't want you to get undertreated \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\93.0\D\1.14\2.5\and have it come back \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\94.0\D\1.14\3.5\and as you mentioned, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\95.0\D\1.14\2.14\you can't work, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\96.0\D\1.14\2.14\you don't know when you're gonna get sick\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\97.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\98.0\D\1.14\2.2\We don't know how can we miss it, \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\99.0\D\1.14\83.0\it is something else.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\100.0\D\1.14\5.1\So let's just, let's just really blow this one down, okay?\11.0\1.0\\\\R\
43.0\101.0\P\1.14\3.6\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
44.0\102.0\D\1.15\2.1\Now she's calling \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
44.0\103.0\D\1.15\2.1\and texting, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
44.0\104.0\D\1.15\5.3\we want to put you down for just another quick CT to see\13.0\1.0\\\\P\
45.0\105.0\P\1.15\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\106.0\D\1.15\2.1\Exactly where that little [2w]\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\107.0\P\1.15\1.121\I'm not gonna have to drink all this stuff \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\108.0\P\1.15\1.121\and wait another forty minutes?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\109.0\D\1.15\2.13\None of that.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\110.0\P\1.15\2.66\Okay, good.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\111.0\D\1.15\2.1\In fact, they don't even have to inject you with anything. \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\112.0\D\1.15\2.1\ They want to catch it as it's coming out of your kidneys now. \13.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\113.0\D\1.15\2.1\ So she said about an hourandahalf if we're gonna get it going right away. \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\114.0\D\1.15\82.0\ So let's\2.0\1.0\\\\R\
51.0\115.0\P\1.15\6.21\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
52.0\116.0\D\3.0\6.2\Let me just get you a prescription for that, if that's okay.\12.0\1.0\\\\R\
53.0\117.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\4.2
54.0\118.0\D\1.14\3.3\Now the other thing is this low potassium that you had. \11.0\2.0\low potassium\2.2\D\P\
54.0\119.0\D\1.14\2.1\ Somehow whenever we check it in [name other hospital] it's normal. \11.0\2.0\\\\P\
54.0\120.0\D\1.14\2.69\ This is driving me nuts. \5.0\2.0\\\\P\
54.0\121.0\D\1.14\2.63\ [chuckles]\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
55.0\122.0\P\1.14\3.1\yeah\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
56.0\123.0\D\1.14\1.121\And you don't feel muscle weakness like?\7.0\2.0\\\\P\
57.0\124.0\P\1.15\2.1\The lady out there told me that if it doesn't get spun within a couple hours, um then it, the potassium is like out of it \26.0\2.0\\\\P\
57.0\125.0\P\1.15\2.1\and it'll give a different reading\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
58.0\126.0\D\1.15\3.1\Uh huh\2.0\2.0\\\\P\
59.0\127.0\P\1.15\2.1\[3w] [name] told me that.\5.0\2.0\\\\P\
60.0\128.0\D\1.15\3.1\Right.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
61.0\129.0\P\1.15\2.12\And you know, maybe the lab here is so busy, \10.0\2.0\\\\I\
61.0\130.0\P\1.15\2.12\maybe it's not getting spun right away.\7.0\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\131.0\D\1.15\2.4\You know, and it should, \5.0\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\132.0\D\1.15\2.2\if I'm not mistaken, it usually causes it to be high when they do that, \15.0\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\133.0\D\1.15\2.1\cuz I think the cells start to break. \8.0\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\134.0\D\1.15\2.2\ I'm pretty sure that's what she's talking about.  So\9.0\2.0\\\\P\
63.0\135.0\P\1.16\2.11\I'm just gobbling potassium. \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
63.0\136.0\P\1.16\2.11\ I mean I've been you know, I've been eating every food out of the [1w]\15.0\2.0\\\\P\
64.0\137.0\D\1.16\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\2.0\\\\P\
65.0\138.0\P\1.16\2.11\And the internet. \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
65.0\139.0\P\1.16\2.11\ I've been eating every kind of food that I like that's got any potassium.\14.0\2.0\\\\P\
66.0\140.0\D\1.16\3.4\Okay, \1.0\2.0\\\\P\
66.0\141.0\D\1.15\1.12\well did you get that 24hour urine by chance?\9.0\2.0\\\\P\
67.0\142.0\P\1.15\2.11\No.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
68.0\143.0\D\1.15\1.122\No?\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
69.0\144.0\P\1.15\2.11\That's why I did it today, \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
69.0\145.0\P\1.15\2.1\cuz [name] thought you might want more of my body fluids\11.0\2.0\\\\P\
70.0\146.0\D\1.15\3.1\yeah yeah\2.0\2.0\\\\P\
71.0\147.0\P\1.15\2.1\or something while I'm [crosstalk 2w].\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
72.0\148.0\D\1.15\82.0\Cuz the way to tell, really, \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
72.0\149.0\D\1.16\5.7\I mean it's good that you're taking the potassium, \9.0\2.0\\\\P\
72.0\150.0\D\1.16\2.1\that's correcting it  \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
72.0\151.0\D\1.14\2.1\but if you have some kind of underlying problem, it's like people normally don't have to take all these highpotassium foods to keep it up.\25.0\2.0\\\\I\
73.0\152.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
74.0\153.0\D\1.14\2.1\Usually your kidneys hang onto it pretty well, \8.0\2.0\\\\I\
74.0\154.0\D\1.14\2.1\unless, I've seen like people that are drinking, when you're drinking heavy, you're not getting very many good nutrition out of [2w] potassium sort of [crosstalk 3w].\27.0\2.0\\\\I\
75.0\155.0\P\2.2\2.11\I'm not doing that.\4.0\2.0\\\\P\
76.0\156.0\D\1.14\2.1\Diarrhea \1.0\2.0\\\\I\
76.0\157.0\D\6.0\2.1\and diuretics, \2.0\2.0\\\\I\
76.0\158.0\D\6.0\2.1\some people that take weight loss pills \7.0\2.0\\\\I\
76.0\159.0\D\6.0\2.1\and things like that. \4.0\2.0\\\\I\
76.0\160.0\D\6.0\2.14\ We asked about this last time\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
77.0\161.0\P\6.0\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
78.0\162.0\D\1.14\2.1\Or chronic diarrhea.  \3.0\2.0\\\\I\
78.0\163.0\D\1.14\2.1\And usually again, it's not a subtle thing, \8.0\2.0\\\\I\
78.0\164.0\D\1.14\2.1\and yeah, I do go five or ten times a day .\12.0\2.0\\\\I\
79.0\165.0\P\1.14\3.6\Really?  \1.0\2.0\\\\I\
79.0\166.0\P\1.14\2.1\Nothing like that going on.\5.0\2.0\\\\P\
80.0\167.0\D\1.14\2.64\Yeah, I'm puzzled. \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
80.0\168.0\D\3.0\2.121\ And I'm leaving for three weeks.  \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
80.0\169.0\D\1.14\2.4\I feel like we have this, we're on top of this now, a bit.\14.0\2.0\\\\P\
81.0\170.0\P\1.14\2.63\[Laughs].\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
82.0\171.0\D\1.14\82.0\But I still, \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
82.0\172.0\D\1.14\2.14\whatever it is with this potassium, it's been going on since at least last February, \15.0\2.0\\\\P\
82.0\173.0\D\1.14\2.1\because that's when I first noticed it. \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
82.0\174.0\D\1.14\2.1\ Now the risk, of course, is when the potassium gets very low, you can have a heart arrhythmia.\18.0\2.0\\\\I\
83.0\175.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
84.0\176.0\D\1.14\82.0\So it's not just, \4.0\2.0\\\\I\
84.0\177.0\D\1.15\2.2\I know I could just chase lab numbers \8.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\178.0\D\1.15\2.1\because the lab's abnormal. \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\179.0\D\1.15\2.61\ It does have some concern there. \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\180.0\D\1.15\3.7\ Now that said, \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\181.0\D\1.14\2.14\you've lived with it almost, I almost, intermittent, \8.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\182.0\D\1.14\2.4\but doing very well and been fine. \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
84.0\183.0\D\1.15\5.1\ But you know, at the very least we should recheck it when I come back \15.0\2.0\\\\R\4.4
84.0\184.0\D\1.15\5.1\and probably get this 24hour urine test if it is again low, \12.0\2.0\\\\R\4.4
84.0\185.0\D\1.16\5.4\and you just keep eating that potassium stuff.  But\9.0\2.0\\\\R\
85.0\186.0\P\1.16\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\R\2.1
86.0\187.0\D\1.16\3.2\You know.  \2.0\2.0\\\\P\
86.0\188.0\D\1.16\3.4\Okay, \1.0\2.0\\\\P\
86.0\189.0\D\3.0\2.121\so I'm gonna get an order for this uh urine test\11.0\2.0\\\\P\
87.0\190.0\P\1.15\1.121\Then do I have to do a 24hour urine test, do you mean like do, you know, two days in a row?\22.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\191.0\D\1.15\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\192.0\D\1.15\5.4\ What you do is you get up in the morning and pee.  \12.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\193.0\D\1.15\5.4\And then that whole day, you pee into the toilet \10.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\194.0\D\1.15\5.4\and then the whole day you have to pee, basically into a jar.  \13.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\195.0\D\1.15\5.4\You get up at night you have to pee into that jar. \12.0\2.0\\\\I\
88.0\196.0\D\1.15\5.4\ And then you get up the next morning, you have to go and pee in that jar.\17.0\2.0\\\\I\
89.0\197.0\P\1.15\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
90.0\198.0\D\1.15\2.1\And then it gives us in a full 24 hours how much potassium you're losing. \15.0\2.0\\\\I\
90.0\199.0\D\1.15\2.1\ And if we see there's a lot of potassium in there, \11.0\2.0\\\\I\
90.0\200.0\D\1.15\2.1\yet your blood is low, it means the kidneys aren't holding onto this very well.\15.0\2.0\\\\I\
91.0\201.0\P\3.0\6.1\Can I take that, can I do that at the [name of place]?\13.0\2.0\\\\P\
92.0\202.0\D\3.0\5.6\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
93.0\203.0\P\3.0\2.121\Or if not, I will be back in this building next Wednesday to see Dr. [name of other doctor].\19.0\2.0\\\\P\
94.0\204.0\D\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
95.0\205.0\P\3.2\2.121\And to do the survey.\5.0\2.0\\\\P\
96.0\206.0\D\3.2\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
97.0\207.0\P\11.0\11.0\So\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
98.0\208.0\D\3.0\5.6\um you could do it here, or at [name of place].  Either one.  \13.0\2.0\\\\P\
98.0\209.0\D\3.0\2.4\Probably easier here \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
98.0\210.0\D\3.0\2.1\just because it's easier to order here. \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
98.0\211.0\D\3.0\5.4\ But then you'd have to turn it in again after 24 hours, so.\13.0\2.0\\\\P\
99.0\212.0\P\3.0\2.4\Yeah, that's the hard part here.\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
100.0\213.0\D\3.0\2.45\That's the tough one.  \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
100.0\214.0\D\3.0\2.121\It's gonna have to be in [name of place].\9.0\2.0\\\\P\
101.0\215.0\P\3.0\3.1\yeah\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
102.0\216.0\D\1.15\2.1\So, And again, if you're potassium, we have to show that your potassium level in the blood is low at the same time.  \23.0\2.0\\\\P\
102.0\217.0\D\1.15\2.1\Because if I ate a bunch of potassium now, my body should get rid of it.\16.0\2.0\\\\I\
103.0\218.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
104.0\219.0\D\1.15\1.31\If my potassium's low, it should, that make sense?\9.0\2.0\\\\I\
105.0\220.0\P\1.15\2.2\Yeah.\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
106.0\221.0\D\1.15\2.121\So if you're normal now we just check against [name of place].\12.0\2.0\\\\R\
107.0\222.0\P\1.15\2.63\[Laughs].\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
108.0\223.0\D\1.15\3.4\So anyway, long story short, but\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
109.0\224.0\P\1.15\2.1\I've never been normal.  \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
109.0\225.0\P\1.15\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
110.0\226.0\D\1.16\5.4\Keep eating that potassium for now. \6.0\2.0\\\\R\
110.0\227.0\D\1.15\5.1\ Let's recheck it like in January, \6.0\2.0\\\\R\
110.0\228.0\D\1.15\5.1\we'll recheck a blood test\5.0\2.0\\\\R\
111.0\229.0\P\1.15\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\R\
112.0\230.0\D\3.0\2.121\And I'll give you the script for something to just take to them, [name of place].\16.0\2.0\\\\R\
113.0\231.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\R\
114.0\232.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay?\1.0\2.0\\\\R\4.1
115.0\233.0\P\3.0\2.4\Yeah it helps if I have something to take them \10.0\2.0\\\\P\
115.0\234.0\P\3.0\2.1\because there's always all kinds of confusion out there about things not being in the computer and\17.0\2.0\\\\P\
116.0\235.0\D\3.0\2.2\Oh I know, it's\4.0\2.0\\\\P\
117.0\236.0\P\3.0\2.1\If I have to sit in their waiting room for three hours with sick people hacking around me \18.0\2.0\\\\P\
117.0\237.0\P\1.14\2.1\and then I've got a cold \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
117.0\238.0\P\1.14\2.63\[laughs] \1.0\2.0\\\\P\
117.0\239.0\P\1.14\2.121\I'm wearing a mask next time I'm coming here\9.0\2.0\\\\P\
118.0\240.0\D\1.14\2.1\The other thing is if you do have a stone in here,  \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
118.0\241.0\D\1.14\2.4\they should figure this out by today, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
118.0\242.0\D\1.16\5.3\we need you to drink a lot to get rid of that stone \13.0\1.0\\\\R\
118.0\243.0\D\1.16\5.3\and wash that through that kidney.\6.0\1.0\\\\R\
119.0\244.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
120.0\245.0\D\1.16\2.1\So I'm not one of these doctors that prescribes six glasses of water every day, \15.0\1.0\\\\P\
120.0\246.0\D\1.16\5.3\but this is a case where you do need to be doing that.\13.0\1.0\\\\R\
121.0\247.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
122.0\248.0\D\1.16\3.4\So, okay, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
122.0\249.0\D\3.0\2.121\so we're gonna get this in, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
122.0\250.0\D\3.0\5.1\and then why don't you just pop back here \9.0\X\\\\\
122.0\251.0\D\3.0\2.121\and you're done. \3.0\X\\\\\
122.0\252.0\D\1.14\2.121\ And I'll be able to tell you if that definitely is in\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\253.0\P\1.14\3.1\ok\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
124.0\254.0\D\1.14\11.0\your kidney or not. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
124.0\255.0\D\1.14\2.121\ And then if it is, this also needs followup with making sure that's cleared out, so\16.0\1.0\\\\P\
125.0\256.0\P\1.14\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
125.0\257.0\P\3.4\3.3\And wait, \2.0\3.0\gas cutoff\1.0\P\P\
125.0\258.0\P\3.4\2.5\I've got something I wanted to ask you [name of doctor]\11.0\3.0\\\\P\
126.0\259.0\D\3.4\3.1\Sure.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
127.0\260.0\P\3.4\2.2\I know you wrote a little blurb about the utilities.\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\261.0\D\3.4\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
129.0\262.0\P\2.7\2.1\I got the gas cutoff notice here\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
130.0\263.0\D\2.7\4.1\ahh\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
131.0\264.0\P\2.7\82.0\and it says, \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
131.0\265.0\P\3.4\2.2\somebody told me that they thought they had their own form that had to be filled out.\17.0\3.0\\\\P\
132.0\266.0\D\3.4\3.1\Okay.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
133.0\267.0\P\3.4\2.1\And here's the little note,  Termination shall take place. \9.0\3.0\\\\P\

134.0\269.0\D\3.4\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\3.0\\\\P\
135.0\270.0\P\3.4\2.1\And it says,  If they were notified orally \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
135.0\271.0\P\3.4\2.1\and then it could followup in writing, \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
135.0\272.0\P\3.4\5.2\ but I thought maybe if you could call them, And then\11.0\3.0\\\\P\
136.0\273.0\D\3.4\2.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
137.0\274.0\P\3.4\82.0\they can um, \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
137.0\275.0\P\3.4\2.121\then if they have a special form, then maybe they could fax it to you?\15.0\3.0\\\\P\
138.0\276.0\D\3.4\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
139.0\277.0\P\3.4\2.121\So that we can get that done right before you run away to India.\14.0\3.0\\\\P\
