2.0\2.0\\99.0\99.0\Reviewed by Tatiana 03/02/09\4.0\\\\\\
3.0\3.0\D\1.13\2.1\So I got your resistance test back.\7.0\1.0\RESISTANCE\4.21\D\P\
4.0\4.0\P\1.13\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
5.0\5.0\D\1.13\2.4\And uh it's a complicated one, you know.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\6.0\P\1.13\2.12\Well I thought it might be, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\7.0\P\1.13\2.14\because you know I've been around for a long time.  \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\8.0\P\1.13\2.63\[Laughs].\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\9.0\D\1.13\3.6\Yeah. Yeah. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\10.0\D\1.13\2.1\I mean I have to say it's the most unique one I've seen, \13.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\11.0\D\1.13\2.1\and I've seen a lot of these tests.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\12.0\P\1.13\3.6\Really?  Huh.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
9.0\13.0\D\1.13\3.2\But uh let me just - \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
9.0\14.0\D\3.0\1.12\can you see my PC \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
9.0\15.0\D\81.0\81.0\cuz I [crosstalk 5w].\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
10.0\16.0\P\81.0\81.0\Uh - [3w]. \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
10.0\17.0\P\83.0\83.0\I'll get that.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
11.0\18.0\D\1.13\2.1\And that doesn't necessarily mean that's a bad thing. \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
11.0\19.0\D\1.14\2.1\ I mean what's most important is your immune system's good.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
12.0\20.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
13.0\21.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
14.0\22.0\P\11.0\11.0\Mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\23.0\D\1.13\2.5\I just wanna explain.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\24.0\D\1.13\2.1\So here's how we look at the immune system and CD4 count. \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
15.0\25.0\D\1.13\2.1\ And you've been pretty stable here all the way back to 2002.  \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\26.0\D\3.0\2.1\And I've got some more records, by the way, from Dr. [name of doctor]'s office, \15.0\2.0\MORE RECORDS\2.1\D\P\
15.0\27.0\D\3.0\2.1\[it's been put] in my box \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
15.0\28.0\D\3.0\2.5\and I'd like to do that, okay?\7.0\2.0\\\\P\
16.0\29.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
17.0\30.0\D\3.0\2.121\[1w] cruise through some of them.  \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
17.0\31.0\D\3.0\81.0\And also Dr. [name of doctor] [4w].\7.0\2.0\\\\P\
18.0\32.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay, mhm.\2.0\2.0\\\\P\
19.0\33.0\D\3.0\2.121\[2w] sit down with those tonight.\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
20.0\34.0\P\3.0\1.121\Now you don't have anything from California?  From\8.0\2.0\\\\P\
21.0\35.0\D\3.0\2.132\Way back? \2.0\2.0\\\\P\
21.0\36.0\D\3.0\2.13\ No.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
22.0\37.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
23.0\38.0\D\3.0\2.71\Hopefully he summarized some of that, \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
23.0\39.0\D\3.0\2.11\like I do, \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
23.0\40.0\D\3.0\2.11\where I go back \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
23.0\41.0\D\3.0\2.11\and do what I can. \5.0\2.0\\\\P\5.0
23.0\42.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Um - now the viral loads, again, very low. \9.0\1.0\RESISTANCE\\\P\
23.0\43.0\D\1.13\2.64\ And I'm surprised, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\44.0\D\1.11\2.4\because Dr. [name of doctor] knows what he's doing. \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\45.0\D\1.11\2.1\ Like he usually doesn't keep someone on therapy that's failing\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\46.0\P\1.11\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\47.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay? \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\48.0\D\1.14\2.12\ But I think what his thought process was, was that your immune system's doing so well, \16.0\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\49.0\D\1.13\2.12\that even though you've got some lowlevel virus here, um you know\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\50.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
27.0\51.0\D\1.11\2.12\Best to keep on\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\52.0\P\1.11\3.1\Right.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
29.0\53.0\D\1.11\3.2\You know?  So\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\54.0\P\1.13\2.1\Well he felt that although we didn't have a resistance test, \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\55.0\P\1.13\2.1\he felt that I was resistant to lots of things.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\56.0\D\1.13\3.1\Right.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\57.0\P\1.13\82.0\And\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\58.0\D\1.13\2.4\And he was right.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\59.0\P\1.13\1.121\Lot of resistance.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\60.0\D\1.13\2.13\Mhm.  Yeah, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\61.0\D\1.13\2.4\and he's right. \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\62.0\D\82.0\82.0\ Now the one, you know, I'll argue for getting it\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
36.0\63.0\P\83.0\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\64.0\D\5.31\5.1\Would be that we could switch - \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\65.0\D\5.31\81.0\maybe that [5w] undetectable, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\66.0\D\5.31\5.1\but prevent further resistance from cropping up, is the other idea.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\
38.0\67.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\68.0\D\5.31\2.1\And you know again, what I could see in short is that this is just very complicated here, \18.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\69.0\D\5.31\2.1\especially to the class of the [2w] \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\70.0\D\5.31\2.1\or the nucleosides, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\71.0\D\5.31\2.1\like the AZT drugs, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\72.0\D\5.31\2.1\the Videx, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\73.0\D\5.31\2.1\the Tenofovir, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\74.0\D\5.31\2.14\things that you're on.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\75.0\D\5.31\2.1\You have this very complicated resistance pattern there.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\76.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\77.0\D\5.31\2.11\And what we do is \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\78.0\D\5.31\3.7\just to let you know \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\79.0\D\5.31\11.0\is we look here and see where all the mutations are in the virus, \14.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\80.0\D\5.31\2.11\and then we go down and see, you know, which of these drugs it may be susceptible to. \18.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\81.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And there are some, \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\82.0\D\5.31\2.1\like for instance, 3TC, \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
41.0\83.0\D\5.31\2.1\which is [2w] Epivir\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
42.0\84.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
43.0\85.0\D\5.31\2.1\You seem to be pretty susceptible to that one.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
44.0\86.0\P\5.31\1.122\Susceptible meaning?\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
45.0\87.0\D\5.31\2.121\It'll work.  It'll work.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\88.0\P\5.31\3.6\Oh, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\89.0\P\5.31\82.0\well I thought - \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\90.0\P\5.31\2.1\he thought that would not work.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\91.0\D\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\92.0\P\5.31\2.64\That's interesting.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\93.0\D\5.31\3.6\Yeah.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\94.0\D\5.31\1.12\Now you may already have had a resistance to that in the past and \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\95.0\D\5.31\1.12\but you've lost it since you've been on it\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\96.0\P\5.31\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\97.0\D\5.31\3.4\But so that's one. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\98.0\D\5.31\3.3\ Then the other one would be one of the protease inhibitors, \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\99.0\D\5.31\2.14\and I take it from this pattern that you've been on some of those in the past.\17.0\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\100.0\P\5.31\2.13\Quite a few, yeah.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\101.0\D\5.31\3.6\Yeah.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\102.0\D\5.31\2.1\Now some of the newer ones have pretty good coverage over this resistance that you have here.\17.0\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\103.0\P\5.31\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\104.0\P\5.31\2.1\I don't think I've been on any of the newer ones \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\105.0\P\5.31\2.1\except Viracept, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\106.0\P\5.31\2.1\if that's considered a new one.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\107.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\108.0\D\5.31\2.1\That's - yeah, not that new.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\109.0\P\5.31\1.122\Not that new?\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\110.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\111.0\D\5.31\5.1\Let's see here.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\112.0\P\5.31\2.1\I think that's the newest one I've been on. . . . \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\113.0\P\5.31\3.3\Um Yeah, I had a question about Norvir\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\114.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\115.0\P\5.31\2.14\Cuz that's used to boost quite a few.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\116.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah, yeah.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\117.0\P\5.31\1.11\What's the situation on that one?\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\118.0\D\5.31\2.12\Probably would need Norvir.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\119.0\P\5.31\1.122\Would need Norvir?\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
65.0\120.0\D\5.31\2.13\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\121.0\P\5.31\1.122\I can take Norvir?\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
67.0\122.0\D\5.31\2.13\You can.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\123.0\P\5.31\3.6\Okay. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\124.0\P\5.31\2.1\ Because I took it for a short\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\125.0\D\5.31\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\126.0\P\5.31\11.0\period of time \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\127.0\P\5.31\2.1\and went off it \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\128.0\P\5.31\2.1\because of the - the . . . not the subjective side effects, \13.0\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\129.0\P\5.31\2.1\but the lipid\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\130.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\131.0\P\5.31\11.0\Problems. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\132.0\P\5.31\2.1\ And they didn't even put me on Lipitor to try to - \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\133.0\P\5.31\2.1\it was so high, the triglycerides were\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\134.0\D\5.31\3.1\Hmm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
74.0\135.0\P\11.0\11.0\Very high.  \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
74.0\136.0\P\5.31\2.1\But that was with an early, full dose of Norvir,\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
75.0\137.0\D\5.31\3.1\Ok\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
76.0\138.0\P\5.31\2.1\not the little helping dose.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\139.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay.  Yeah, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\140.0\D\5.31\2.1\cuz the low helping doses, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\141.0\D\5.31\3.7\as you say, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\142.0\D\5.31\11.0\are boosting [3w].\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\143.0\P\5.31\81.0\[3w].\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\144.0\D\5.31\2.1\Those don't affect it so much. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\145.0\D\5.31\2.1\It will somewhat, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\146.0\D\5.31\5.4\and you'll have to remind me of that, that we just\11.0\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\147.0\P\5.31\81.0\[5w] numbers, in that regard\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
81.0\148.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
82.0\149.0\P\5.31\81.0\[5w].\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\150.0\D\5.31\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\151.0\D\5.31\5.1\but we should recheck it after starting.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\152.0\D\5.31\5.4\Just remind me \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\153.0\D\5.31\2.121\so I don't forget that. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\154.0\D\5.31\2.4\ I should remember on my own, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\155.0\D\5.31\81.0\but I'm not - I don't [crosstalk 3w].\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\156.0\P\5.31\6.21\I will.  \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\157.0\P\5.31\2.63\[Laughs].\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\158.0\D\5.31\3.4\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\159.0\D\5.31\5.1\so on the protease inhibitor we can start. \8.0\1.0\\\\\
85.0\160.0\D\5.31\2.12\ Um It would probably be one of the newer ones \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\161.0\D\5.31\2.1\that's not on here. \4.0\1.0\\\\\
85.0\162.0\D\5.31\82.0\ So the ones you've taken, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\163.0\D\5.31\1.121\you said you've taken Viracept?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
86.0\164.0\P\5.31\2.13\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
87.0\165.0\D\5.31\2.14\And then you've taken Norvir, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
87.0\166.0\D\5.31\82.0\and you've probably taken\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
88.0\167.0\P\5.31\82.0\Took a little bit - \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
88.0\168.0\P\5.31\2.13\I took a full dose of Norvir.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
89.0\169.0\D\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
90.0\170.0\P\5.31\3.2\Uh let's see, what else here?\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\171.0\D\5.31\1.121\[3w]?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
92.0\172.0\P\5.31\2.13\I've taken that.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
93.0\173.0\D\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
94.0\174.0\P\5.31\2.1\Kidney stones.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
95.0\175.0\D\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\176.0\P\5.31\82.0\Kaletra's - \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\177.0\P\5.31\3.2\oh right - \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\178.0\P\5.31\2.4\Tenovir's no good obviously\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
97.0\179.0\D\5.31\2.43\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\180.0\P\5.31\82.0\Norvir's\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
99.0\181.0\D\5.31\3.1\Right right.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
100.0\182.0\P\5.31\81.0\[6w] about that.  \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
100.0\183.0\P\5.31\2.1\Oh Invirase, I've taken.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\184.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\185.0\D\5.31\81.0\ [3w].  [4w] older ones now.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\

114.0\200.0\P\5.31\2.1\And I've taken this one. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
114.0\201.0\P\5.31\82.0\The question is\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\202.0\D\5.31\82.0\I think the bottom line of what I'd like to do is \12.0\1.0\\\\R\

117.0\205.0\D\5.31\2.11\We often run [these 1w] by them when they're complicated like that.\12.0\1.0\\\\R\
118.0\206.0\P\5.31\3.1\All right.\2.0\1.0\\\\R\
119.0\207.0\D\5.31\2.4\I feel like I could cook up a regimen for you, \11.0\1.0\\\\R\
119.0\208.0\D\5.31\2.1\but it's just complicated enough that\6.0\1.0\\\\R\
120.0\209.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
121.0\210.0\D\5.31\2.5\Once in a while we like to just run it by them.\12.0\1.0\\\\R\4.1

123.0\212.0\D\5.31\82.0\Well you have - \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\213.0\D\5.31\2.44\sorry.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
123.0\214.0\D\5.31\82.0\Mainly of these drugs here\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
124.0\215.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
125.0\216.0\D\5.31\2.1\We call them nucleosides.\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
126.0\217.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\218.0\D\5.31\2.1\The AZT, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\

127.0\221.0\D\5.31\2.1\this group. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\222.0\D\5.31\2.1\ You have a lot of resistance, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\223.0\D\5.31\2.1\and it's the\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
128.0\224.0\P\5.31\2.2\That makes sense.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
129.0\225.0\D\11.0\11.0\The unusual kind\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
130.0\226.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\227.0\D\5.31\2.1\Not that we see up here. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\228.0\D\5.1\5.1\ So I think the debate really is one of simply let's just continue what you're going with right now \19.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\229.0\D\5.1\2.1\because it's crippling this virus - \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\230.0\D\5.1\2.1\it's mutated, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\231.0\D\5.1\2.1\it can't function very well, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\232.0\D\5.1\2.1\knowing that it's not helping completely, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\233.0\D\5.31\5.1\versus trying to change to something else \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\234.0\D\5.31\2.121\that we can really suppress it completely.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\235.0\D\5.31\2.4\Because if we change to something else that's kind of doing the same as what we're doing now, what's the point?\21.0\1.0\\\\P\
132.0\236.0\P\5.31\2.43\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
133.0\237.0\D\5.31\1.31\You know what I mean?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\238.0\P\5.31\2.2\Sure.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
135.0\239.0\D\5.31\5.1\If it was an emergency, like you had AIDS, basically, then we'd say we'd gotta go for broke here.  \19.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\240.0\D\5.31\5.1\And there are things, by the way, we can turn to. \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\241.0\D\5.31\2.1\ There's an injectable\3.0\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\242.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\243.0\D\5.31\2.1\That's a completely different class\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
138.0\244.0\P\5.31\3.1\Right.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
139.0\245.0\D\5.31\2.1\It's very effective. \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
139.0\246.0\D\5.31\2.1\ It's a big lifestyle change.\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
140.0\247.0\P\5.31\2.2\Yeah, I've heard  [crosstalk 3w].\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\248.0\D\5.31\3.6\You've heard that?  Okay.  \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\249.0\D\5.31\2.4\No fun.\2.0\1.0\\\\I\
142.0\250.0\P\5.31\2.43\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
143.0\251.0\D\5.31\2.4\It's basically like getting a bee sting twice a day, \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
143.0\252.0\D\5.31\3.7\to put it simply.\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
144.0\253.0\P\5.31\6.22\Rather not do that.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\254.0\D\5.31\3.6\Right.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\255.0\D\5.31\2.1\If we're dealing with AIDS, we didn't have other options, \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\256.0\D\5.31\5.1\I'd be pressing to consider something like that. \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\257.0\D\5.31\2.1\ There's another [1w] drug that's out now \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\258.0\D\5.31\2.1\that's again another completely different class, \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\259.0\D\5.31\2.1\which means you wouldn't have any resistance to what appears to be a very um potent, \16.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\260.0\D\5.31\2.1\and really an exciting drug. \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\261.0\D\5.31\5.1\ And that would be one to consider. \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\262.0\D\5.31\5.1\ Again, if we're dealing with AIDS I'd be pushing you to get down there and consider that one.  \18.0\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\263.0\D\5.31\5.1\You know, without that, it's something we should think about. \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\264.0\D\5.31\2.11\ And that's the kind of thing that I run by my colleagues down there\14.0\1.0\\\\R\
146.0\265.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\266.0\D\5.31\2.11\See what they think. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\267.0\D\5.31\5.1\ Um And so what we would do is probably use a couple of these, \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\268.0\D\5.31\2.2\knowing that it's not gonna do a whole lot, \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\269.0\D\5.31\2.5\basically just trying to preserve these mutations, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\270.0\D\5.31\2.5\keep this thing crippled, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\271.0\D\5.31\5.1\then using a protease inhibitor, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\272.0\D\5.31\5.1\probably plus probably one of these new medications to really suppress it completely.\13.0\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\273.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\274.0\D\11.0\11.0\Okay? \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\275.0\D\5.31\2.4\ And a lot depends on you, to be honest. \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\276.0\D\5.31\1.22\ Is it something that you're kind of willing to do, \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\277.0\D\5.31\1.12\is it things you've had side effects from before, \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\278.0\D\5.31\1.12\and you know, trouble. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
149.0\279.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And that's kind of how we decide what the regimen is.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\
150.0\280.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
151.0\281.0\D\5.31\2.1\Someone might have the exact same tests here, \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
151.0\282.0\D\5.31\2.1\but had problems with Norvir that they couldn't tolerate, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
151.0\283.0\D\5.31\2.1\couldn't deal with the loose stools\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\284.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
153.0\285.0\D\5.31\2.1\You know Things like that that we might have to deal with\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
154.0\286.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
155.0\287.0\D\5.31\2.1\That makes everybody unique. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
155.0\288.0\D\5.31\2.4\ And that's kind of where I am.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
156.0\289.0\P\5.31\3.6\Okay. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
156.0\290.0\P\1.14\3.3\ Now as far as - speaking of stools\8.0\3.0\STOOL\4.1\P\P\

171.0\310.0\D\6.0\82.0\ But some of the anti[1w]. \5.0\5.0\\\\P\
171.0\311.0\D\5.31\2.12\ To answer your question, "Will this make that worse?" you know, in a way it might make it better.\19.0\5.0\\\\R\

175.0\317.0\D\1.14\2.1\You know, someone who's having trouble evacuating their bowels \9.0\5.0\\\\P\

212.0\372.0\P\5.31\2.13\Early '90s kind of dose, yeah.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
213.0\373.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay, so\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
214.0\374.0\P\5.31\2.2\But you know I might tolerate a small amount of it as a helper drug, I don't know.\18.0\1.0\\\\P\
215.0\375.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
216.0\376.0\P\5.31\1.12\Am I resistant to that?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
217.0\377.0\D\5.31\2.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
218.0\378.0\P\5.31\2.121\Oh, well then we won't use it anyway.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
219.0\379.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
219.0\380.0\D\5.31\2.1\and it's - again, sometimes we keep it in there just - \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
219.0\381.0\D\5.31\3.7\it sounds weird, \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
219.0\382.0\D\5.31\1.31\but does that make sense, keeping it mutated \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
219.0\383.0\D\5.31\1.31\so that the virus doesn't grow as well?  Does that?\10.0\1.0\\\\I\
220.0\384.0\P\5.31\2.2\Well, not really, \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
220.0\385.0\P\5.31\2.2\I don't really know enough about any - \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
220.0\386.0\P\5.31\2.2\I used to kind of know about these things. \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
220.0\387.0\P\5.31\2.2\ I don't so much anymore.  \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
220.0\388.0\P\5.31\2.5\I try to keep up with it.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
221.0\389.0\D\5.31\2.1\Well basically what it is is think of somebody, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
221.0\390.0\D\5.31\2.1\if you're on a drug, it would keep the virus actually a mutant, \13.0\1.0\\\\I\
221.0\391.0\D\5.31\2.1\kind of crippled, in a way. \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
221.0\392.0\D\5.31\2.1\ It's resistant, \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
221.0\393.0\D\5.31\2.1\but in order to be resistant to these drugs, it has to change its structure\15.0\1.0\\\\I\
222.0\394.0\P\5.31\2.2\Yeah, I understand that.\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\395.0\D\11.0\11.0\To where it can live.  \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\396.0\D\5.31\2.1\So even though the drugs aren't working, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\397.0\D\5.31\2.1\they are doing something.  \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\398.0\D\5.31\2.1\Cuz what we found is someone like you who has a pretty high level of resistance, \16.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\399.0\D\5.31\2.121\if we take you off these drugs, the viral load is gonna shoot up \14.0\1.0\\\\I\
223.0\400.0\D\5.31\2.121\and the CD4 count is gonna go down.\8.0\1.0\\\\I\
224.0\401.0\P\5.31\3.6\Right, \1.0\1.0\\\\I\
224.0\402.0\P\5.31\2.5\don't want that to happen.\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
225.0\403.0\D\5.31\2.131\Don't want that to happen.  \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
225.0\404.0\D\5.31\2.11\And that's what we tried, actually, back in the year 2000, you know, things like that \16.0\1.0\\\\I\
225.0\405.0\D\5.31\2.1\and say, "Well, drugs don't seem to be working."  \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
225.0\406.0\D\5.31\2.1\And then they did studies, "Why don't we keep people on these drugs that don't work."\16.0\1.0\\\\I\
226.0\407.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
227.0\408.0\D\5.31\2.1\And they found they did much better.  \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
227.0\409.0\D\5.31\5.1\You know, even, frankly, another option is just staying on two drugs, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
227.0\410.0\D\5.31\3.7\as weird as that sounds, \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
227.0\411.0\D\5.31\2.12\because the third one that you're resistant to probably isn't doing anything, and that's the Viramune.\16.0\1.0\\\\P\
228.0\412.0\P\5.31\3.6\Oh okay.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
229.0\413.0\D\5.31\2.1\So that doesn't seem to have this crippling effect once you're resistant to it, \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
229.0\414.0\D\5.31\2.1\the virus has no problem.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
230.0\415.0\P\5.31\1.121\So I may as well go off that?\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
231.0\416.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah, that would be a consideration, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
231.0\417.0\D\5.31\2.1\which is totally against what you read in textbooks - "Why would you be on only two drugs?"  And\19.0\1.0\\\\P\
232.0\418.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
233.0\419.0\D\5.31\2.1\But that's what we call a holding pattern - to put people on one or two drugs to kind of hold them, \22.0\1.0\\\\I\
233.0\420.0\D\5.31\2.121\with the idea that, you know, there's a new drugs that's gonna be released next year. \16.0\1.0\\\\I\
233.0\421.0\D\5.31\2.11\ All we're doing now is trying to hold that viral load down a little bit, \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
233.0\422.0\D\5.31\2.121\and then we're gonna do this fullon treatment. \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
233.0\423.0\D\5.31\5.1\ So I wouldn't recommend stopping it now, \7.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
233.0\424.0\D\5.31\2.121\but it's one thing that we may decide to do.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
234.0\425.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
235.0\426.0\D\1.13\2.61\The only thing that bothers me a little bit about doing stuff like that is your viral load did tend to be kind of heading up. \26.0\1.0\\\\P\
235.0\427.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Although it's still very low\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
236.0\428.0\P\1.13\3.1\Yeah?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
237.0\429.0\D\1.13\82.1\If the trend continues\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
238.0\430.0\P\1.13\1.12\Now did this last time, did it go down, \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
238.0\431.0\P\1.13\1.12\or did it continue heading up a little?\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
239.0\432.0\D\1.13\3.2\Let's see\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
240.0\433.0\P\1.13\2.14\Cuz my T cells went up quite a bit the last time.\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
241.0\434.0\D\1.13\2.4\And that's the most important, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
241.0\435.0\D\1.13\3.7\as you know.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
242.0\436.0\P\1.14\2.12\And I think it could be because of that terrible sleep problem, you know, \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
242.0\437.0\P\1.14\2.12\certainly can't have been doing my immune system any good\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
243.0\438.0\D\1.14\3.6\Not good.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
244.0\439.0\P\1.14\2.1\And when that got turned around I think I really - well I certainly felt a lot better.\18.0\1.0\\\\P\
245.0\440.0\D\1.13\1.121\So last one was on the 14th, does that sound correct?  Last blood test?\14.0\1.0\\\\P\
246.0\441.0\P\1.13\1.122\Uh, what?\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
247.0\442.0\D\1.13\1.121\Of March?\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
248.0\443.0\P\1.13\2.13\Yeah, that sounds about right.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
249.0\444.0\D\1.13\82.0\So\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
250.0\445.0\P\1.13\2.1\And then after that I had [4w].\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
251.0\446.0\D\1.13\2.1\Yeah, this was something [2w] - \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
251.0\447.0\D\1.13\2.1\you're in the 100s here, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
251.0\448.0\D\1.13\2.1\and then you're kind of bumping into the 1,000s\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
252.0\449.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
253.0\450.0\D\1.13\2.4\So that probably is a significant jump, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
253.0\451.0\D\1.13\2.1\but again, time of day, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
253.0\452.0\D\1.13\2.1\lab you use\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
254.0\453.0\P\1.13\2.13\Yeah, right.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
255.0\454.0\D\1.13\2.4\You know, these numbers aren't that big of a deal.\10.0\1.0\\\\I\
256.0\455.0\P\1.13\3.6\Right. \1.0\1.0\\\\I\
256.0\456.0\P\1.13\2.2\ Enough to see a trend.\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
257.0\457.0\D\1.13\82.0\So.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
258.0\458.0\P\1.13\1.121\But the trend has been up slightly?\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\459.0\D\1.13\2.13\I mean at least from this 500 to 4,000. \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\460.0\D\1.13\2.121\ And if - it wouldn't be unusual for it to be like if we checked again in another month or so, 10,000, \22.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\461.0\D\1.13\2.121\20000.0\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\462.0\D\1.13\2.121\And then 40,000, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\463.0\D\1.13\2.1\and then seeing a drift down in the CD4 count. \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\464.0\D\1.13\2.4\ What I think would argue against that, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\465.0\D\1.13\2.63\[chuckles] \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\466.0\D\1.13\2.14\you've been bumping along like that for now almost five years.  \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
259.0\467.0\D\1.13\2.1\I mean usually when you start to see this, way back there\12.0\1.0\\\\P\
260.0\468.0\P\1.13\3.1\Yeah?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
261.0\469.0\D\1.13\2.121\You'd be on your way up with a year or two - up into the 40,000s.  \16.0\1.0\\\\P\
261.0\470.0\D\1.13\2.4\You seem to just hold that virus down pretty well.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
262.0\471.0\P\1.13\2.65\Oh good.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
263.0\472.0\D\5.31\2.5\So you know I don't mean to sound so noncommittal and - \12.0\1.0\\\\R\
263.0\473.0\D\5.31\2.2\there's a lot of wrong answers of things to do \10.0\1.0\\\\R\
263.0\474.0\D\5.31\2.2\and there's a lot of right answers.\7.0\1.0\\\\R\
264.0\475.0\P\5.31\2.2\Well I know sometimes it's better not to do things than it is to do so something, you know, just in principle.\22.0\1.0\\\\R\
265.0\476.0\D\5.31\2.43\Exactly.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
266.0\477.0\P\5.31\1.121\But - well - so the best thing would be to wait until you've conferred with the\17.0\1.0\\\\R\
267.0\478.0\D\5.31\2.13\Right.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
268.0\479.0\P\11.0\11.0\With your associates.\3.0\1.0\\\\R\
269.0\480.0\D\11.0\11.0\Yeah, yeah\2.0\1.0\\\\R\
270.0\481.0\P\5.31\1.121\And then look at some options at that point.\9.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\482.0\D\5.31\2.13\Look at some options. \4.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\483.0\D\5.31\5.1\ I can call \3.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\484.0\D\5.31\5.1\and we can either decide, let's hold things, \8.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\485.0\D\5.31\5.1\let's quit the Viramune \4.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\486.0\D\5.31\5.1\and just get one of these holding patterns drugs \9.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\487.0\D\5.31\5.1\and watch your counts carefully, \5.0\1.0\\\\R\
271.0\488.0\D\5.31\5.1\or the third point would be let's really try to get you on a regimen that we feel there's a pretty good chance of knocking this virus all the way down to undetectable.\33.0\1.0\\\\R\
272.0\489.0\P\5.31\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\1.0\\\\R\
273.0\490.0\D\5.31\5.3\And you know, that's gonna be our goal. \8.0\1.0\\\\R\4.4
273.0\491.0\D\99.0\99.0\ [Cell phone ringing]. \3.0\T\\\\\
273.0\492.0\D\3.0\2.121\ Let me just shut that off. \6.0\T\\\\\
273.0\493.0\D\5.31\1.31\ So - does that make sense?\6.0\1.0\\\\R\
274.0\494.0\P\5.31\2.2\Yeah.  \1.0\1.0\\\\R\
274.0\495.0\P\3.0\1.121\So then I guess what I expect to hear from you is after you've had that [4w].\17.0\6.0\LOGISTICS\3.1\P\P\
275.0\496.0\D\3.0\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
275.0\497.0\D\3.0\1.12\What's the best number to reach you at?\8.0\6.0\\\\P\
276.0\498.0\P\3.0\2.1\##########.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
277.0\499.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
277.0\500.0\D\3.0\5.4\And if you don't hear from me by the end of the week, give a call \16.0\6.0\\\\R\
277.0\501.0\D\3.0\5.4\or call [name of PA]\5.0\6.0\\\\R\
278.0\502.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\6.0\\\\R\
279.0\503.0\D\3.0\5.4\"Give your doctor a knock on the head, I'm waiting to hear about some resistance tests."\16.0\6.0\\\\R\
280.0\504.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\6.0\\\\R\
281.0\505.0\D\3.0\2.121\There's a chance that I might not get a hold of them tomorrow [2w].\14.0\6.0\\\\I\
282.0\506.0\P\3.0\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
282.0\507.0\P\5.31\2.5\I'd kind of like to see if we could get the thing suppressed entirely, \14.0\1.0\RESISTANCE\\\P\
282.0\508.0\P\5.31\2.2\but I'm - objectively I don't really know what the path - you know? \14.0\1.0\\\\R\
282.0\509.0\P\5.31\2.63\[chuckles]\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
283.0\510.0\D\5.31\2.4\No I think that is the best, \7.0\1.0\\\\\
283.0\511.0\D\5.31\2.1\and what we do, again, depends on what your [crosstalk 3w].\11.0\1.0\\\\\
284.0\512.0\P\5.31\1.121\What would be the downside of\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
285.0\513.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
286.0\514.0\P\5.31\1.121\Trying to get it down completely?\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
287.0\515.0\D\5.31\3.2\Uh\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
288.0\516.0\P\5.31\1.121\That I'd develop more resistance to more things?\8.0\1.0\\\\I\
289.0\517.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\I\
289.0\518.0\D\5.31\3.3\here's one thing.  Like let's say we only had one new drug. \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
289.0\519.0\D\5.31\2.1\ What typically happens is is that if you're resistant to everything we're using, and we add one new drug, \19.0\1.0\\\\I\
289.0\520.0\D\5.31\2.1\the Epivir, I mentioned.\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
290.0\521.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
291.0\522.0\D\5.31\2.121\You're likely just to develop that\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
292.0\523.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
293.0\524.0\D\5.31\2.1\And then we've lost another drug.\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
294.0\525.0\P\5.31\3.1\Right.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
295.0\526.0\D\5.31\2.1\So the rule of thumb is when you change, change to at least two drugs that the person's going to be susceptible to, \23.0\1.0\\\\I\
295.0\527.0\D\5.31\2.1\because then you're less apt to get resistance.\8.0\1.0\\\\I\
296.0\528.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
297.0\529.0\D\5.31\2.4\So that's the thing.  So that's the thing I would confer on, is like, "What do you think are chances are of really getting this person undetectable, is that we have two new drugs to use?" \36.0\1.0\\\\I\
297.0\530.0\D\5.31\2.121\ I'm gonna call the research group, \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
297.0\531.0\D\5.31\2.121\see if we can get you on that new research drug \11.0\1.0\\\\R\
297.0\532.0\D\5.31\1.22\if you're interested in that\5.0\1.0\\\\R\
298.0\533.0\P\5.31\2.5\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
299.0\534.0\D\5.31\2.121\And if you qualify for it. \6.0\1.0\\\\R\4.1
299.0\535.0\D\5.31\2.12\ I think you would.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
299.0\536.0\D\5.31\2.1\My [N of 1], I have one patient that's started it now \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
299.0\537.0\D\5.31\2.1\and has done very well, \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
299.0\538.0\D\5.31\2.1\who actually has much higher viral resistance than you have.  \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
299.0\539.0\D\5.31\2.12\This may be unique to her \6.0\1.0\\\\I\

406.0\721.0\P\5.31\2.1\I've never gotten neuropathy, for example.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
407.0\722.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm, mhm.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
408.0\723.0\P\5.31\2.1\And the only one that I really had that was bad - well, the lipodystrophy\15.0\1.0\\\\P\
409.0\724.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
410.0\725.0\P\5.31\11.0\That has been a problem.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
411.0\726.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
412.0\727.0\P\5.31\2.1\And high lipids initially. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
412.0\728.0\P\5.31\2.1\ But now that seems to be in pretty good control, so.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\
413.0\729.0\D\5.31\3.6\Mhm. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
413.0\730.0\D\5.31\1.121\ But beyond going by [1w] Videx and [1w], right?\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
414.0\731.0\P\5.31\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
415.0\732.0\D\5.31\2.121\That's gonna add to that, a little bit.\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
416.0\733.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
417.0\734.0\D\5.31\81.0\The lipodystrophy [crosstalk 2w]\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
418.0\735.0\P\5.31\1.121\That's one that we might get rid of, Videx?\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
419.0\736.0\D\5.31\2.13\Yeah, mhm.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
420.0\737.0\P\5.31\2.1\Because you know 1992 it was invented. \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
421.0\738.0\P\5.31\82.0\So  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
421.0\739.0\P\5.31\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
422.0\740.0\D\5.31\2.4\That's probably the biggest plan - fat loss in the legs, \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
422.0\741.0\D\5.31\2.4\arms\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
423.0\742.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
424.0\743.0\D\5.31\2.4\And the face.  \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
424.0\744.0\D\5.31\2.4\So that would be nice to try to get rid of that.  \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
424.0\745.0\D\5.31\2.121\[Name of patient], let me write [3w] here, and - yeah.\11.0\W\\\\\
425.0\746.0\P\5.31\2.1\And then the other big side effect I had on the Viracept \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
425.0\747.0\P\5.31\82.0\and also on - \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
425.0\748.0\P\5.31\2.2\I forget which one before that, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
425.0\749.0\P\11.0\11.0\was diarrhea.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
426.0\750.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
427.0\751.0\P\5.31\2.2\I forget [9w].\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
428.0\752.0\D\5.31\3.1\Right. Right\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
429.0\753.0\P\5.31\2.1\I had diarrhea for years.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
430.0\754.0\D\5.31\3.6\Mhm.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
430.0\755.0\D\5.31\1.121\It's the Combivir, probably, \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
430.0\756.0\D\5.31\1.121\or probably the Fortovase\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
431.0\757.0\P\5.31\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
432.0\758.0\D\5.31\2.1\That causes that.  So\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
433.0\759.0\P\5.31\81.0\And it was really [4w].\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
434.0\760.0\D\5.31\2.1\Again, the new protease inhibitors, it's mainly the Norvir that can do that.  \13.0\1.0\\\\P\
434.0\761.0\D\5.31\2.1\The good news is it tends to be a lot less than it is with those others you mentioned, \19.0\1.0\\\\P\
434.0\762.0\D\5.31\2.1\plus your body tends to get used to it\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
435.0\763.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
436.0\764.0\D\5.31\2.1\So it's worse the first couple weeks, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
436.0\765.0\D\5.31\2.1\and then a lot of times\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
437.0\766.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
438.0\767.0\D\11.0\11.0\Things settle down.  \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
438.0\768.0\D\5.31\2.1\Most commonly what my patients will say is that, "You know, I have two bowel movements a day.  \18.0\1.0\\\\P\
438.0\769.0\D\5.31\2.1\I kind of have to watch for bathrooms more than I did, \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
438.0\770.0\D\5.31\2.1\but I'm doing fine with it."\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
439.0\771.0\P\5.31\2.4\Yeah.  That would be okay, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
439.0\772.0\P\5.31\2.72\I mean I really wouldn't worry about it \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
439.0\773.0\P\5.31\2.1\since I'm retired.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
440.0\774.0\D\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
441.0\775.0\P\5.31\2.72\So it's not a problem \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
441.0\776.0\P\5.31\81.0\[4w].\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\777.0\D\5.31\3.6\Yeah.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\778.0\D\5.31\2.1\Some of them, the older ones really had the - you know, people were having trouble  if they were a waiter, \21.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\779.0\D\5.31\2.1\or were traveling.  \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\780.0\D\5.31\2.1\[2w] bus drivers, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\781.0\D\5.31\2.1\that's one you really gotta work on, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\782.0\D\5.31\2.1\because they have to start that on their days off \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
442.0\783.0\D\5.31\2.1\and make sure they're okay\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
443.0\784.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
444.0\785.0\D\5.31\2.1\Cuz that would be disabling for them.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
445.0\786.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah. Yeah\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
446.0\787.0\D\5.31\3.2\You know. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
446.0\788.0\D\5.31\2.4\ So that's how everyone's unique, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
446.0\789.0\D\5.31\2.4\and that's what kind of makes this, you know, I guess fun \12.0\1.0\\\\E\
446.0\790.0\D\5.31\2.4\or a challenge \3.0\1.0\\\\E\
446.0\791.0\D\5.31\3.2\or whatever - \3.0\1.0\\\\E\
446.0\792.0\D\5.31\2.4\everybody's different, so\3.0\1.0\\\\I\
