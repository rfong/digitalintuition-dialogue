45.0\63.0\P\6.0\2.13\Nope. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\\

46.0\65.0\D\6.0\3.6\Oh\1.0\4.0\\\\P\\
47.0\66.0\P\6.0\2.1\It's a lotion, \3.0\4.0\\\\P\\

47.0\68.0\P\6.0\2.1\ [1w] Dove, \2.0\4.0\\\\P\\
47.0\69.0\P\6.0\2.11\I was using it as a lotion, \7.0\4.0\\\\P\\

48.0\71.0\D\6.0\81.0\Oh [crosstalk 3w].\3.0\4.0\\\\P\\
49.0\72.0\P\6.0\2.11\And by me not wiping it off, \7.0\4.0\\\\P\\
49.0\73.0\P\6.0\2.1\but soap dried up on my leg\7.0\4.0\\\\P\\
50.0\74.0\D\6.0\3.1\Oh yeah.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\\
51.0\75.0\P\6.0\2.1\And that's what it was.  That's what it was back there.\11.0\4.0\\\\P\\
52.0\76.0\D\6.0\2.64\Wow. \1.0\4.0\\\\E\\
52.0\77.0\D\6.0\2.4\ Okay, well so now you know better than that.\9.0\4.0\\\\E\\
53.0\78.0\P\6.0\2.43\Yeah, I know better now.\5.0\4.0\\\\E\\
54.0\79.0\D\6.0\5.1\You could wash your hands with [1w], \7.0\4.0\\\\P\\
54.0\80.0\D\6.0\5.1\maybe just leave it alone for now.\7.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\81.0\P\6.0\6.21\Yeah, yeah, \2.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\82.0\P\6.0\2.1\but it did make your hands feel soft, \8.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\83.0\P\6.0\2.11\and I was using it as a lotion, \8.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\84.0\P\6.0\2.11\and I wasn't taking it off. \6.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\85.0\P\6.0\2.1\ And when she showed me the pictures, different pictures, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\86.0\P\6.0\2.1\and there was a picture that came up there, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\87.0\P\6.0\2.4\I said, "That's that's me, all the way."  \8.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\88.0\P\6.0\2.62\I mean it hurted, \4.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\89.0\P\6.0\2.1\it was [1w] all up.  \5.0\4.0\\\\P\\
55.0\90.0\P\6.0\2.11\I said, "I will never do that again."\8.0\4.0\\\\P\\
56.0\91.0\D\6.0\2.66\Well that's good.\3.0\4.0\\\\E\\
57.0\92.0\P\6.0\11.0\Never.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\5.0\
58.0\93.0\D\1.13\2.1\So the good news is that your you know your  T cells \12.0\5.0\blood counts\4.22\D\P\\
58.0\94.0\D\1.13\2.1\and everything are still very good on these medicals.\9.0\5.0\\\\P\\
59.0\95.0\P\1.13\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\\
60.0\96.0\D\5.14\1.12\How long have you been taking this combination - the Combivir and the Nelfinavir?\14.0\5.0\\\\P\\
61.0\97.0\P\5.1\2.69\Oh God.  \2.0\5.0\\\\P\\
61.0\98.0\P\5.1\2.1\[I've been on it for] ten years..\7.0\5.0\\\\P\\
62.0\99.0\D\5.1\1.122\Has it been ten years?\5.0\5.0\\\\P\\
63.0\100.0\P\5.1\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\\
64.0\101.0\D\5.1\3.6\Okay, \1.0\5.0\\\\P\5.0\
64.0\102.0\D\5.1\3.3\tell me let me ask you about this.  \8.0\6.0\changing meds\2.1\D\P\\
64.0\103.0\D\5.1\2.1\You know, Obviously you're doing great on it. \8.0\6.0\\\\P\\
64.0\104.0\D\5.1\2.1\ Um - if, you know, today, we were just starting out, no one would be put on Combivir \18.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\105.0\D\5.1\2.1\and Nelfinavir, \2.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\106.0\D\5.2\2.1\because it can cause problems with some people, \8.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\107.0\D\5.31\2.1\and it doesn't look as well as some other new medicines.  \11.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\108.0\D\5.1\2.4\Of course, it doesn't [real] count \6.0\6.0\\\\P\\
64.0\109.0\D\5.1\2.14\because you haven't had that many problems \7.0\6.0\\\\P\\
64.0\110.0\D\5.1\2.14\and it worked great. \4.0\6.0\\\\P\\
64.0\111.0\D\5.31\1.22\ So the one question is should we actually switch around the medicines that are likely to be easier on you, \20.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\112.0\D\5.31\1.22\and in the shortterm, you know in your system, you'd have much less [side effects]. \15.0\6.0\\\\I\\
64.0\113.0\D\5.2\1.22\ So do you think the Combivir/ Nelfinavir give you any problems?\11.0\6.0\\\\P\\
65.0\114.0\P\5.2\2.1\No.  \1.0\6.0\\\\P\\
65.0\115.0\P\1.14\3.3\I was gonna ask you. \5.0\7.0\stomach big\2.1\P\P\\
65.0\116.0\P\1.14\2.1\ My stomach is big, \4.0\7.0\\\\P\\
65.0\117.0\P\1.14\82.0\but they said my liver and something\7.0\7.0\\\\P\\
66.0\118.0\D\1.14\81.0\[10w]?\1.0\7.0\\\\P\\
67.0\119.0\P\1.14\2.1\It stays there.\3.0\7.0\\\\P\\
68.0\120.0\D\1.14\1.12\So it's okay?\3.0\7.0\\\\P\\
69.0\121.0\P\1.14\2.1\Yeah.\1.0\7.0\\\\P\\
70.0\122.0\D\1.14\2.12\Well that could be because the [1w] is a [1w].\10.0\7.0\\\\I\\
71.0\123.0\P\1.14\2.1\And they checked the liver, \5.0\7.0\\\\P\\
71.0\124.0\P\1.14\2.1\kidneys \1.0\7.0\\\\P\\
71.0\125.0\P\1.14\2.1\and everything.  \2.0\7.0\\\\P\\
71.0\126.0\P\1.14\2.1\They said [2w].\3.0\7.0\\\\P\\
72.0\127.0\D\5.2\82.0\Well maybe what we should do - \7.0\7.0\\\\P\\
72.0\128.0\D\5.2\1.12\now, do they think [1w] is partly - did they say they thought it was probably fat inside you that was - that got sort of blown out because of the medicine, or what?\34.0\7.0\\\\P\\
73.0\129.0\P\5.2\2.1\No, \1.0\7.0\\\\P\\
73.0\130.0\P\5.2\2.1\nobody said nothing.\3.0\7.0\\\\P\\
74.0\131.0\D\5.2\82.0\I really - \3.0\7.0\\\\P\\
74.0\132.0\D\5.2\6.2\we'll check it out [2w].  \5.0\7.0\\\\P\\
74.0\133.0\D\5.2\2.12\It is possible - certainly these medicines they can make you - \12.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\134.0\D\5.2\2.1\they kind of change the way your body handles fat a little bit, \13.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\135.0\D\5.2\2.1\and they can cause body shape changes. \7.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\136.0\D\5.2\2.1\ Some people have a little bit more fat, \8.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\137.0\D\5.2\2.1\some a little bit less fat. \6.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\138.0\D\5.2\82.0\ And one - \3.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\139.0\D\5.2\2.1\so there's two things to do. \6.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\140.0\D\5.2\2.1\ One is there's there's actually a separate [2w] to this, \10.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\141.0\D\5.2\2.1\that tries to handle sort of some of those side effects, \11.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\142.0\D\5.2\2.1\try to make them less. \5.0\7.0\\\\I\\
74.0\143.0\D\5.2\2.1\ It's like a metabolic furnace, they call it.\8.0\7.0\\\\I\\
75.0\144.0\P\5.2\3.1\Mhm\1.0\7.0\\\\I\\
76.0\145.0\D\5.2\2.1\And then the other thing is [1w] actually - \9.0\6.0\changing meds\\\R\\
76.0\146.0\D\5.31\5.1\you shouldn't hold on to those medicines. \7.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\147.0\D\5.31\2.1\ There's a possibility for you to switch you to a simpler set of medicines \14.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\148.0\D\5.31\2.1\that you only take once a day. \7.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\149.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And so [probably] one pill is called Truvada. \8.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\150.0\D\5.31\2.1\ It's like the Combivir, \4.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\151.0\D\5.31\2.1\but you only take it once a day. \8.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\152.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And the other is called Reyataz, \6.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\153.0\D\5.31\2.1\you just need to take one pill a day. \9.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\154.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And you take it along with one Norvir pill. \9.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\155.0\D\5.31\2.1\ So you take three pills a day at one sitting. \10.0\6.0\\\\R\\
76.0\156.0\D\5.31\2.1\ And that should do as much\6.0\6.0\\\\R\\
77.0\157.0\P\5.31\81.0\[What 3w]?\2.0\6.0\\\\R\\
78.0\158.0\D\5.31\81.0\As the [3w].  \3.0\6.0\\\\R\\
78.0\159.0\D\5.31\1.22\And as long as it agrees with you, \8.0\6.0\\\\R\\
78.0\160.0\D\5.31\2.5\which I think it will.\5.0\6.0\\\\R\\
79.0\161.0\P\5.31\82.1\Dr. [name of doctor]\4.0\6.0\\\\R\\

85.0\168.0\P\5.1\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\6.0\\\\R\\
86.0\169.0\D\5.2\1.12\Does the Nelfinavir give you any diarrhea, ever, or no? \10.0\6.0\\\\P\\
86.0\170.0\D\5.2\2.1\ No.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\\
87.0\171.0\P\1.14\2.1\I stays constipated.  \3.0\8.0\constipated\2.1\P\P\\
