43.0\74.0\P\5.31\3.1\Right.\\5.0\\\\I\
44.0\75.0\D\5.31\2.1\So it's a three combination pill. \\5.0\\\\I\
44.0\76.0\D\5.31\2.1\ It's got the Viread, \\5.0\\\\I\
44.0\77.0\D\5.31\2.1\the Epivir, \\5.0\\\\I\

55.0\99.0\P\5.31\2.2\Mhm.\\5.0\\\\I\
56.0\100.0\D\5.31\2.1\What they've done is Truvada, the Truvada companies and the Sustiva companies have merged, \\5.0\\\\I\
56.0\101.0\D\5.31\2.1\and they put their drugs into one pill, \\5.0\\\\I\
56.0\102.0\D\5.31\2.1\and they call it Atripla, \\5.0\\\\I\
56.0\103.0\D\5.31\2.1\triple meaning three.\\5.0\\\\I\

59.0\106.0\P\5.31\1.121\That's it.\\5.0\\\\I\
60.0\107.0\D\5.31\2.13\That's it.\\5.0\\\\I\
61.0\108.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\\5.0\\\\I\
62.0\109.0\D\5.0\2.1\So we've gone from many many many many pills,\\5.0\\\\I\

64.0\111.0\D\5.0\82.1\Well back in the old days\\5.0\\\\I\
65.0\112.0\P\5.0\2.1\I was, no, I was.\\5.0\\\\P\

67.0\114.0\P\5.0\1.12\Is that what the cocktail was?\\5.0\\\\I\
68.0\115.0\D\5.0\2.1\The cocktail was a lot of pills, \\5.0\\\\I\
68.0\116.0\D\5.0\2.1\plus most of the people were also on prevention medicines, \\5.0\\\\I\
68.0\117.0\D\5.0\82.0\but their pill burden a day was, \\5.0\\\\I\
68.0\118.0\D\5.0\2.1\I had some patients that were taking 20 pills a day.\\5.0\\\\I\
69.0\119.0\P\5.0\2.4\That's a lot.\\5.0\\\\I\
70.0\120.0\D\5.0\2.1\And not all those were the cocktail, \\5.0\\\\I\
70.0\121.0\D\5.0\82.0\but the numbers have, remembered when, I don't, \\5.0\\\\I\
70.0\122.0\D\5.0\1.121\you never took Kaletra, did you?\\5.0\\\\P\
71.0\123.0\P\5.0\2.13\No.\\5.0\\\\P\

72.0\125.0\D\5.0\2.1\just for that one drug, \\5.0\\\\I\
72.0\126.0\D\5.0\2.1\so that was six.  \\5.0\\\\I\

74.0\129.0\D\5.0\11.0\You know, it was more. \\5.0\\\\I\
74.0\130.0\D\5.31\2.1\ So one pill, once a day is as simple as it gets.\\5.0\\\\R\
75.0\131.0\P\5.31\3.1\Okay.\\5.0\\\\R\
76.0\132.0\D\5.31\2.65\So that's great.  \\5.0\\\\R\

112.0\212.0\D\1.16\3.1\Mhm.  Mhm.\\8.0\\\\P\
113.0\213.0\P\1.16\2.11\And a lot of fruit [4w] like fruit cocktail, that's what I used to do. \\8.0\\\\P\
113.0\214.0\P\1.16\2.11\ But it's not like I'm pouring down gobs and gobs of fried food and, you know\\8.0\\\\P\
114.0\215.0\D\1.16\2.66\Good good.  \\8.0\\\\P\
114.0\216.0\D\1.16\3.4\Okay, \\8.0\\\\P\
114.0\217.0\D\1.14\2.12\well I think that like I said before that you probably have a pretty high metabolic rate.  \\8.0\\\\P\
114.0\218.0\D\2.5\1.12\Are your parents overweight?\\8.0\\\\P\
115.0\219.0\P\2.5\2.1\Yes. \\8.0\\\\P\
115.0\220.0\P\2.5\2.1\ And since that both retired, it's just gotten that much worse, \\8.0\\\\P\
115.0\221.0\P\2.5\82.1\because you know, for the past ten\\8.0\\\\P\
116.0\222.0\D\1.14\1.12\Were they thin when they were younger?\\8.0\\\\P\
117.0\223.0\P\1.14\2.1\I'm adopted, \\9.0\family health\4.1\P\P\
117.0\224.0\P\1.14\81.0\so for whatever [3w].\\9.0\\\\P\
118.0\225.0\D\1.14\3.6\Oh, okay.  \\9.0\\\\P\
118.0\226.0\D\1.14\2.12\Yeah, well so the genes don't mean anything.\\9.0\\\\P\
119.0\227.0\P\2.5\2.1\But my mother, she's diabetic \\9.0\\\\P\
119.0\228.0\P\2.5\2.1\and she's on these meds, \\9.0\\\\P\
119.0\229.0\P\2.5\2.1\and some of the side effects are weight gain.\\9.0\\\\P\
120.0\230.0\D\2.5\2.13\Exactly.\\9.0\\\\P\
121.0\231.0\P\2.5\2.1\My dad, he just shovels food down constantly.\\9.0\\\\P\5.0
122.0\232.0\D\1.14\1.221\So we don't know anything about your biological parents?\\8.0\\\\P\
123.0\233.0\P\1.14\2.2\I have no idea.\\8.0\\\\P\
124.0\234.0\D\1.14\3.7\Well like I said, \\8.0\\\\P\
124.0\235.0\D\1.14\2.4\I think, you know, having a high metabolism is good, \\8.0\\\\P\
124.0\236.0\D\1.14\2.1\because it means that you usually have a lot of energy, \\8.0\\\\P\
124.0\237.0\D\1.14\2.1\it keeps you lean, mean, and all that good stuff.  So\\8.0\\\\P\
125.0\238.0\P\82.0\82.1\I think that\\8.0\\\\P\
126.0\239.0\D\3.0\2.1\So anyway, here's your refill on the, \\2.0\\\\R\4.2
126.0\240.0\D\5.142\1.121\so you're not taking the Atripla?  \\6.0\\\\P\

153.0\288.0\P\1.14\2.1\but one thing I must do doctor is I find myself catching these colds, \\11.0\colds\2.1\P\P\

160.0\308.0\D\1.13\2.65\which is very good.  Very good. \\13.0\\\\R\1.12
160.0\309.0\D\3.0\5.3\ Um, what I want to check is, \\T\\\\\

161.0\311.0\P\3.0\2.43\yeah that's right\\T\\\\\
162.0\312.0\D\3.0\82.0\And so I can't, \\T\\\\\

164.0\315.0\D\1.17\1.121\So you completed you're A vaccination series. \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\316.0\D\3.0\6.2\ Let me go in through, \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\317.0\D\3.0\2.1\we're now keeping . . . a record of, \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\318.0\D\3.0\2.1\so your last pneumovax was 03/30/06. \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\319.0\D\3.0\2.66\ So that's good, \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\320.0\D\3.0\2.1\so, so your pneumonia shot shot is uptodate.  \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\321.0\D\3.0\2.1\And your last tetanus was in '05, \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\322.0\D\3.0\2.1\so you're uptodate with that.  \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\323.0\D\3.0\2.121\The one thing I am going to do today is recheck, \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\324.0\D\3.0\2.1\I can't find where we checked for hepatitis B. \\12.0\\\\P\
164.0\325.0\D\1.17\6.2\ If that antibody is negative, we will give you the vaccination series,  \\12.0\\\\P\

167.0\332.0\P\4.0\2.63\[Laughs].\\\\\\\
168.0\333.0\D\3.0\5.4\But flu shots are due today. \\11.0\\\\R\
168.0\334.0\D\3.0\2.1\ We have flu vaccine in the clinic.\\11.0\\\\R\
169.0\335.0\P\3.0\6.21\Okay.\\11.0\\\\R\
170.0\336.0\D\3.0\5.4\And um, go ahead and get that out of the way. \\11.0\\\\R\2.1
170.0\337.0\D\1.17\5.1\ Now, since we're entering flu season, the most important way to prevent getting the flu is handwashing, okay? \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\338.0\D\1.17\82.0\ When you go out, especially when you go out, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\339.0\D\1.17\82.0\or even in your household, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\340.0\D\1.17\2.1\people pick up colds and flulike illnesses by touching services that are contaminated, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\341.0\D\1.17\2.1\and then sort of transferring the virus to their oral, their mouth and eyes and nose, their respiratory system.  \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\342.0\D\1.17\5.1\So washing your hands \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\343.0\D\1.17\5.1\and not biting on your fingernails \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\344.0\D\1.17\5.1\or putting your hands in your mouth \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\345.0\D\1.17\5.1\or touching your face when you've been out and touching everything else is a practice that you try and do, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\346.0\D\1.17\2.1\especially when you're working with the public, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\347.0\D\1.17\2.1\you know, you're shaking people hand, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\348.0\D\1.17\2.1\and who knows where their hands have been ten minutes ago, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\349.0\D\1.17\2.12\rubbing their nose or whatever. \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\350.0\D\1.17\7.0\ So not to gross anybody out \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\351.0\D\1.17\2.63\[laughs],\\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\352.0\D\1.17\2.1\ but you know, germs are everywhere, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\353.0\D\1.17\5.3\so you don't want to transfer the germs to your upper respiratory tract. \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\354.0\D\1.17\5.1\ So washing your hands, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\355.0\D\1.17\5.1\using the hand sanitizers, \\11.0\\\\I\
170.0\356.0\D\1.17\5.1\and now some people even carry around a little container.\\11.0\\\\I\
171.0\357.0\P\1.17\81.0\That's what I had [3w].\\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\358.0\D\1.17\3.2\Yeah, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\359.0\D\1.17\2.1\so, see, I'm rubbing my nose, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\360.0\D\1.17\81.0\but I'm, [3w],\\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\361.0\D\1.17\2.11\ but I'm using my elbow. \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\362.0\D\1.17\5.3\ So just be careful. \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\363.0\D\1.17\2.1\ And that's the best way to prevent getting sick, especially in the flu season, is handwashing.  \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\364.0\D\1.17\5.1\And then, you know, certainly try and stay away from people who are sick, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\365.0\D\1.17\5.1\and if you yourself are sick, you know, staying in and kind of quarantining yourself until you're feeling better. \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\366.0\D\1.17\2.1\ Unfortunately, most people are contagious actually before they're really that sick, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\367.0\D\1.17\2.1\so they don't stay home, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\368.0\D\1.17\2.1\and they're out coughing and sneezing and all that stuff. \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\369.0\D\1.17\2.1\ But you know we can only prevent so much, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\370.0\D\1.17\5.3\but try and do the best that we can. \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\371.0\D\1.17\2.1\ And the flu vaccine, you know, is not 100%, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\372.0\D\1.17\2.5\but hopefully it'll work, \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\373.0\D\1.17\2.5\and if it doesn't work 100%, hopefully it'll give you some protection if you work [1w], so.  \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\374.0\D\1.17\3.2\Um . . . . . so . . . . . okay . . \\11.0\\\\I\
172.0\375.0\D\3.0\2.1\so here's your thing for your flu shot, \\11.0\\\\P\
172.0\376.0\D\3.0\6.2\and I'll mark this off. \\11.0\\\\P\
