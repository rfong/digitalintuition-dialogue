28.0\39.0\D\1.15\2.2\but I don't know \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
28.0\40.0\D\1.15\2.1\because sometimes it takes a while.  \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
28.0\41.0\D\1.15\2.1\No, still pending.\3.0\2.0\\\\P\
29.0\42.0\P\1.15\1.11\Why?\1.0\2.0\\\\I\
30.0\43.0\D\1.15\2.1\It takes a while because they have to process it.  \10.0\2.0\\\\I\
30.0\44.0\D\1.15\2.1\You know it's not just like a blood test and it goes in and they just do the blood test right there. \22.0\2.0\\\\I\
30.0\45.0\D\1.15\2.1\ It's a piece of tissue, piece of [1w] so they have to process it a little bit longer \18.0\2.0\\\\I\
30.0\46.0\D\1.15\2.1\and they have to do all these special things on it.  \11.0\2.0\\\\I\
30.0\47.0\D\1.15\6.3\Let me try a different way maybe. \7.0\2.0\\\\R\4.2
30.0\48.0\D\1.15\2.1\ Some times it might come up. \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
30.0\49.0\D\1.15\1.121\ How you feeling still, no problems?\6.0\3.0\I/D\3.2\P\P\

31.0\51.0\P\1.13\2.61\ Yesterday you know I was a little anxious\8.0\4.0\HEP C RESULT\2.1\P\P\
32.0\52.0\D\1.13\3.1\yea yeah\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
33.0\53.0\P\1.13\2.61\because Dr. [name of doctor] gave me some news that I couldn't really handle too well.\16.0\4.0\\\\P\
34.0\54.0\D\1.13\1.11\What did he say, though?\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
35.0\55.0\P\1.13\2.1\He told me that I had, um, one, you know, the scale of the liver?\15.0\4.0\\\\P\
36.0\56.0\D\1.13\2.1\Yeah, it's okay it's very low.  \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
36.0\57.0\D\1.13\82.0\He explained to you, it's not\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
37.0\58.0\P\1.13\1.11\It's low?\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
38.0\59.0\D\1.13\2.13\Sure, it goes up to 4.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
39.0\60.0\P\1.13\2.2\But I thought 1 was the highest?\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
40.0\61.0\D\1.13\2.43\No, oh no, what he explained to you was that you had genotype 1.\14.0\4.0\\\\I\
41.0\62.0\P\1.13\2.13\Genotype 1, right.\3.0\4.0\\\\I\
42.0\63.0\D\1.13\2.1\That's why it's not high or low, it's what somebody has. \11.0\4.0\\\\I\
42.0\64.0\D\1.13\2.1\ The genotype means the type of the virus. \8.0\4.0\\\\I\
42.0\65.0\D\1.13\2.1\ They are all hepatitis C viruses\6.0\4.0\\\\I\
43.0\66.0\P\1.13\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\4.0\\\\I\
44.0\67.0\D\1.13\2.1\But there are four different kinds of them within hepatitis C.\11.0\4.0\\\\I\
45.0\68.0\P\1.13\2.1\Okay, in one family, so to speak.\7.0\4.0\\\\I\
46.0\69.0\D\1.13\2.1\70% of people within the United States, which are the majority, most people have type 1.\16.0\4.0\\\\I\
47.0\70.0\P\1.13\3.1\Oh.\1.0\4.0\\\\I\
48.0\71.0\D\1.13\2.1\It's not that 1 is better or 2nd is better or 3rd is better or worse.  \16.0\4.0\\\\I\
48.0\72.0\D\1.13\2.1\It doesn't matter. \3.0\4.0\\\\I\
48.0\73.0\D\1.13\2.1\ The disease is the same.\5.0\4.0\\\\I\
49.0\74.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\4.0\\\\I\
50.0\75.0\D\1.13\2.1\It just means that you need to get treated. \9.0\4.0\\\\I\
50.0\76.0\D\1.13\2.1\ 1 is the most difficult to treat, that's what it is.\11.0\4.0\\\\I\
51.0\77.0\P\1.13\2.1\that's what that is\4.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\78.0\D\1.13\2.2\But we don't really actually know that you need treatment at this point, \13.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\79.0\D\1.13\2.1\because last time we did the viral check was really minimal, \11.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\80.0\D\1.13\2.12\so it doesn't need treatment now. \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\81.0\D\1.13\2.12\ So maybe you don't need treatment, \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\82.0\D\1.13\2.1\but you have type 1, that's all.\7.0\4.0\\\\R\1.3
53.0\83.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\4.0\\\\R\
54.0\84.0\D\1.13\1.31\Okay?\1.0\4.0\\\\R\

56.0\86.0\D\1.13\2.13\No, you won't feel anything. \5.0\4.0\\\\P\
56.0\87.0\D\3.0\1.22\ Now and so you want to get a letter today that you can volunteer?\14.0\5.0\LETTER\4.5\P\P\
