105.0\187.0\D\3.0\5.4\Twice a day. \3.0\8.0\\\\R\
105.0\188.0\D\3.0\2.1\If uh I wrote that on the prescription, and that's my bad.\12.0\8.0\\\\E\
106.0\189.0\P\3.0\3.1\Mm okay.\2.0\8.0\\\\E\
107.0\190.0\D\3.0\2.2\I know that I've done that once. \7.0\8.0\\\\E\
107.0\191.0\D\5.0\2.1\ But the higher dose is reserved for people who have failed treatment before.\13.0\8.0\\\\I\
108.0\192.0\P\5.0\3.1\Right.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
109.0\193.0\D\1.14\2.1\You don't qualify for that, \5.0\8.0\\\\P\
109.0\194.0\D\1.14\2.1\you're you're actually doing well on your first medicines, your first group of medicines.\14.0\8.0\\\\P\
110.0\195.0\P\1.14\3.1\um huh\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
111.0\196.0\D\5.0\2.1\You don't need that. \4.0\8.0\\\\P\
111.0\197.0\D\5.0\3.4\ All right \2.0\8.0\\\\P\
111.0\198.0\D\1.14\3.3\well let's talk about, so the main things that trouble, you. \11.0\A\\\\\
111.0\199.0\D\5.12\2.14\ So it sounds like you've been 100% with your medicines \10.0\6.0\ADHERENCE\\\P\
111.0\200.0\D\1.14\2.14\and you've been feeling well. \5.0\6.0\\\\P\
111.0\201.0\D\1.14\2.1\ The hemorrhoids, unfortunately, tend to be a chronic problem.\9.0\1.0\HEMORRHOIDS\\\I\
112.0\202.0\P\1.14\3.6\Oh I see.\3.0\1.0\\\\I\
113.0\203.0\D\1.14\82.0\And what we have to do, \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
113.0\204.0\D\1.14\2.121\so let me explain to you what they are. \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
113.0\205.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Has anyone told you what hemorrhoids really are?\8.0\1.0\\\\I\
114.0\206.0\P\1.14\3.2\uh.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
115.0\207.0\D\1.14\2.1\They are a lot blood vessels that, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
115.0\208.0\D\1.14\2.1\you can think of the colon and the rectum as sort of a, yeah, it's a pipe that lets your stool outside theoretically.\23.0\1.0\\\\I\
116.0\209.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\210.0\D\1.14\2.1\And the bottom part of that pipe is surrounded by a lot of blood vessels, \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\211.0\D\1.14\2.1\because the colon needs a lot of blood supply. \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\212.0\D\1.14\2.1\ And what happens is that um some of the blood vessels that run on the inside of this rectal area um can get very engorged.  \25.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\213.0\D\1.14\2.1\They, because of all the pressure and the blood flow, \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\214.0\D\1.14\2.1\they can start to widen up, bigger blood vessels. \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\215.0\D\1.14\2.1\ And in fact, the blood vessel itself can become swollen \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\216.0\D\1.14\2.1\and partially obstruct the inside of your rectum.  \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\217.0\D\1.14\2.1\So what happens there is um that if it's a very painful obstruction, we usually know that it's a hemorrhoid that's pretty far down.  \24.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\218.0\D\1.14\2.1\If it's not painful, \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\219.0\D\1.14\2.1\but we see obstructional bleeding, \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\220.0\D\1.14\11.0\then we think the hemorrhoid is a little farther up.  \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\221.0\D\1.14\2.1\So that's the difference between an external, or lower down hemorrhoid and internal, higher up. \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
117.0\222.0\D\1.14\1.121\ It sounds like your hemorrhoids hurting in addition to bleeding,\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
118.0\223.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yeah, they hurting.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
119.0\224.0\D\1.14\2.12\So they're probably external hemorrhoids.  \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
119.0\225.0\D\1.14\2.1\And that's usually related to, you know, chronic pressure on that area, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\226.0\D\1.14\2.1\that just makes it hard for the blood vessels to empty out.  \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\227.0\D\1.14\2.1\So they get engorged \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\228.0\D\1.14\2.1\and swollen \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\229.0\D\1.14\2.1\and they start to burst \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\230.0\D\1.14\2.1\and bleed. \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\231.0\D\1.14\2.1\ When they burst and bleed, they can sometimes get infected. \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\232.0\D\1.14\3.3\ So how do we, um, how do we kind of decompress these areas of swelling? \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\233.0\D\1.14\2.1\ That's the focus of care. \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\234.0\D\6.0\2.1\ There are creams \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\235.0\D\6.0\2.1\and stuff that relieve the itching \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\236.0\D\6.0\2.1\and reduce the skin breakdown. \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\237.0\D\8.0\3.3\But what's the main thing? \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\238.0\D\8.0\2.1\ Usually something we call a Sitz bath. \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\239.0\D\8.0\2.1\ Um, the principle behind a Sitz bath, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\240.0\D\8.0\2.1\and you can make these yourself, \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
119.0\241.0\D\8.0\2.1\is to basically um, open up the area in the rectum\11.0\1.0\\\\I\
120.0\242.0\P\8.0\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
121.0\243.0\D\8.0\2.1\And immerse it in hot water uh so that what happens, \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
121.0\244.0\D\8.0\2.1\and it does sting a little bit at first\9.0\1.0\\\\I\
122.0\245.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\246.0\D\8.0\2.1\But you do it every day. \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\247.0\D\8.0\2.1\ What happens is you give these blood vessels a chance to kind of relax \14.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\248.0\D\8.0\2.1\and push the blood out. \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\249.0\D\8.0\2.1\ You know, uh uh relax \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\250.0\D\8.0\2.1\and drain, \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\251.0\D\1.14\2.1\so that eventually, over several days to weeks, these areas of swelling actually go down.  \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\252.0\D\6.0\2.1\You can put as much cream \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\253.0\D\6.0\2.1\or ointment as you want on it, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
123.0\254.0\D\8.0\2.1\but the blood vessels stay swollen until you use this kind of therapy.\13.0\1.0\\\\I\
124.0\255.0\P\8.0\1.122\To decompress it? \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
124.0\256.0\P\8.0\3.6\Yea.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
125.0\257.0\D\8.0\82.0\So basically the way it works, you have like a small, \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
125.0\258.0\D\8.0\2.1\you can actually buy in a drugstore,\7.0\1.0\\\\R\
126.0\259.0\P\8.0\3.1\uh huh\2.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\260.0\D\8.0\5.1\You can ask the pharmacist how to get these, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\261.0\D\8.0\2.1\but usually it's a little pail, \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\262.0\D\8.0\5.4\and you set it up in your bathtub, \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\263.0\D\8.0\5.4\you put pretty warm water in there, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
127.0\264.0\D\8.0\5.4\and you basically just sit uh naked, like before or after you shower\13.0\1.0\\\\R\
128.0\265.0\P\8.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
129.0\266.0\D\8.0\5.4\And you sit like this \5.0\1.0\\\\R\
129.0\267.0\D\8.0\2.1\so that really what this does is that it opens up the butt cheeks \14.0\1.0\\\\R\
129.0\268.0\D\8.0\2.1\so that your rectum is sitting in the water.\9.0\1.0\\\\R\
130.0\269.0\P\8.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
131.0\270.0\D\8.0\2.1\And I mean you should feel the warm water immersing your hemorrhoids.  \12.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
131.0\271.0\D\8.0\2.121\It will sting a little bit at first, \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\272.0\D\8.0\2.121\then it'll start to feel better. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\273.0\D\8.0\2.121\ If you can do that at least once a day, what you'll find is uh eventually your symptoms are going to decrease. \22.0\1.0\\\\R\
131.0\274.0\D\6.0\2.1\ Now in the meantime there are certain overthecounter ointments \9.0\1.0\\\\R\
131.0\275.0\D\6.0\5.1\and creams you can use to relieve the itching\9.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
132.0\276.0\P\81.0\81.0\[Crosstalk 7w]?\2.0\81.0\\\\\
133.0\277.0\D\81.0\81.0\[Crosstalk 5w]. \2.0\81.0\\\\\
133.0\278.0\D\6.0\5.1\ Well, there are other things like Anusol, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
133.0\279.0\D\6.0\1.12\have you tried that?\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\280.0\P\6.0\2.11\No.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
135.0\281.0\D\6.0\2.1\Um, I believe it's a, yeah, it works topically to reduce itching, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\282.0\D\6.0\2.1\and also keeps the area lubricated \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\283.0\D\6.0\2.1\so that the hemorrhoids \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\284.0\D\6.0\2.1\and the skin around it, you know, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\285.0\D\6.0\2.1\the irritation \2.0\1.0\\\\I\
135.0\286.0\D\6.0\2.1\and the skin breakage is relieved.\6.0\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\287.0\P\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\288.0\D\3.1\6.12\I want to take a look back there \8.0\X\\\\\
137.0\289.0\D\1.14\2.1\just to make sure there's no abscess \7.0\X\\\\\
137.0\290.0\D\1.14\2.1\or infection, \2.0\X\\\\\
137.0\291.0\D\6.0\2.1\but uh that's worked pretty well in some of my patients. \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\292.0\D\6.0\2.4\ Anusol.  I think it's got some steroids in there to relieve the inflammation.\13.0\1.0\\\\I\
138.0\293.0\P\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
139.0\294.0\D\8.0\5.1\But the Sitz bath, the ITB, that's where the money is.\11.0\1.0\\\\I\
140.0\295.0\P\8.0\1.12\Is there any solution I put in the water, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
140.0\296.0\P\8.0\1.12\or just regular warm water?\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\297.0\D\8.0\2.4\Uh, in general I think they put warm, \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\298.0\D\8.0\2.4\Sometimes they put in, I think sometimes they put in extra stuff, relieve itching. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\28.0\1.0\\\\I\
142.0\299.0\P\3.0\6.1\Can I use the restroom real quick?\7.0\T\\\\\
143.0\300.0\D\3.0\5.6\Oh yeah.  Sure.  \3.0\T\\\\\
143.0\301.0\D\3.0\1.31\You know where it is?\5.0\T\\\\\
144.0\302.0\P\3.0\1.121\Uh, this way?\3.0\T\\\\\
145.0\303.0\\99.0\99.0\[Patient departs 0:11:48]\3.0\T\\\\\
146.0\304.0\\99.0\99.0\[3 minutes silence]\3.0\T\\\\\
147.0\305.0\\99.0\99.0\[Patient returns 0:14:48]\3.0\T\\\\\
148.0\306.0\D\8.0\2.11\So I just looked it up, the Sitz bath, \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\307.0\D\8.0\2.1\actually there's nothing special about the water. \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
148.0\308.0\D\8.0\2.1\ It's the heat. \3.0\1.0\\\\I\
148.0\309.0\D\8.0\2.1\ The heat is what helps the important blood vessels to relax \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
148.0\310.0\D\8.0\2.1\and drain.\2.0\1.0\\\\I\
149.0\311.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
150.0\312.0\D\6.0\5.1\uh, you can have the pharmacist recommend any alternative to this Anusol.\12.0\1.0\\\\I\
151.0\313.0\P\6.0\3.6\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
152.0\314.0\D\6.0\5.1\So whatever they think is good. \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
152.0\315.0\D\6.0\2.2\ Um.  I know that I've gotten good feedback on the Anusol as to, \13.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\316.0\D\6.0\5.1\basically what's important is that it's something that lubricates the area, \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\317.0\D\6.0\5.1\something that has an antiinflammatory, \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\318.0\D\6.0\5.1\like in this case a steroid. \6.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\319.0\D\6.0\2.1\ So it really calms down all the itching. \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\320.0\D\6.0\2.1\ The itching is the result of inflammation, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\321.0\D\1.14\2.1\which happened because this area is swollen \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\322.0\D\1.14\2.1\and it's getting irritated \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
152.0\323.0\D\1.14\2.1\and it's breaking down.\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
153.0\324.0\P\1.14\3.6\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\

168.0\350.0\D\6.0\2.4\Yeah, it looks like a little bit of steroid uh ointment in uh in some sort of lubricant base should help take care of it.  \25.0\2.0\\\\R\
