52.0\74.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay, \\6.0\\\\P\
52.0\75.0\D\3.0\1.12\and it was - that's - what was the result, did they tell you it was normal?\\6.0\\\\P\
53.0\76.0\P\3.0\2.1\Yes.\\6.0\\\\P\
54.0\77.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay. \\6.0\\\\P\
54.0\78.0\D\3.0\2.14\ Let's see then - let's see - you're right it was normal.\\6.0\\\\P\
55.0\79.0\P\3.0\3.1\Yeah\\6.0\\\\P\
56.0\80.0\D\3.0\2.66\So that's good. \\6.0\\\\P\
56.0\81.0\D\3.0\2.66\ Excellent. \\6.0\\\\P\5.0
56.0\82.0\D\1.14\2.1\ So things seem to be going okay. \\7.0\global\3.2\P\P\
56.0\83.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Any any issues, \\7.0\\\\P\
56.0\84.0\D\1.14\1.12\concerns - \\7.0\\\\P\
56.0\85.0\D\1.14\1.12\anything we need to talk about?\\7.0\\\\P\
57.0\86.0\P\1.14\2.1\No.\\7.0\\\\P\
58.0\87.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay. \\7.0\\\\P\5.0
58.0\88.0\D\3.0\6.12\ And um just looking at the blood work. \\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\89.0\D\3.0\6.12\ I'm just gonna go over all your blood work now to see if there's anything that - \\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\90.0\D\3.0\2.1\usually there's blood tests that we need to do every year or so, \\1.0\\\\I\
58.0\91.0\D\3.0\2.1\or every three months, \\1.0\\\\I\
58.0\92.0\D\3.0\2.1\like CD4 count just to see you know if we are uptodate with everything or what else needs to be done.\\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\93.0\P\3.0\3.6\Okay.\\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\94.0\D\1.13\2.1\Um So your last CD4 count was 390 \\1.0\\\\R\1.12
60.0\95.0\D\1.13\2.1\and that was on March 22nd.  \\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\96.0\D\1.13\2.1\So MarchApril April\\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\97.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhm.\\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\98.0\D\1.13\1.12\Does that seem right?\\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\99.0\P\1.13\2.1\Oh yes, \\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\100.0\P\1.13\2.2\I just [remember cuz I] write it down in my\\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\101.0\D\1.13\3.6\Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\102.0\D\1.13\2.1\so MarchApril is a month, AprilMay - \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\103.0\D\1.13\2.12\so we don't have to repeat it today. \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\104.0\D\1.13\2.1\ We still have some time to do it. \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\105.0\D\1.13\3.2\ Uh And then I tracked you for - \\8.0\hep test\2.1\D\P\
64.0\106.0\D\1.13\2.1\and this is something that we do for every patient for hepatitis \\8.0\\\\I\
64.0\107.0\D\1.15\2.1\and there are three types of this [for] there clinically are three types of hepatitis we have to check you for. \\8.0\\\\I\
64.0\108.0\D\1.15\6.1\Um  So hold on just a second \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\109.0\D\1.15\2.1\I can't  see the results from here.  \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\110.0\D\1.15\2.1\[3w] So hepatitis A, um  your blood work was positive for that, \\8.0\\\\R\
64.0\111.0\D\1.15\2.1\but that means that you had it sometime in the past, not not recently.  \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\112.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um And and in that case, you do not need any vaccinations for that, \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\113.0\D\1.15\2.1\because your body is already making antibodies, \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\114.0\D\1.15\2.12\um and therefore you do not need to be vaccinated to get any additional protection from the vaccine. \\8.0\\\\P\
64.0\115.0\D\1.15\1.31\ So you're good with that forever, okay?\\8.0\\\\P\
65.0\116.0\P\1.15\2.2\Ok. \\8.0\\\\P\
65.0\117.0\P\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\\8.0\\\\P\
66.0\118.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um I checked you for hepatitis C um \\8.0\\\\P\
66.0\119.0\D\1.15\2.1\and it was negative, \\8.0\\\\R\1.12
66.0\120.0\D\1.15\2.66\which is good. \\8.0\\\\P\
66.0\121.0\D\1.15\2.121\ So we just have to continue to check this like every year or so.\\8.0\\\\P\
67.0\122.0\P\1.15\3.6\Okay.\\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\123.0\D\1.15\6.2\Um And I'm looking for the results of the hepatitis B \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\124.0\D\1.15\2.12\which I can't find. \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\125.0\D\1.15\2.14\ So let's see if you got them. \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\126.0\D\1.15\3.2\ Let's see. . Let's . .  \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\127.0\D\1.15\6.2\I will find out with the lab. \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\128.0\D\1.15\2.121\ If you didn't get them, we'll have to repeat it.  \\8.0\\\\P\
68.0\129.0\D\1.15\1.12\Um did your GYN doctors um did test during your last year examination?\\6.0\\\\P\
69.0\130.0\P\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\\6.0\\\\P\
70.0\131.0\D\1.15\3.6\Okay. \\6.0\\\\P\
70.0\132.0\D\1.16\2.1\ Um And how is - we talked about exercising, etc. or\\9.0\weight\3.1\D\P\
71.0\133.0\P\1.16\2.11\I walk.  \\9.0\\\\P\
71.0\134.0\P\1.16\2.11\I exercise [2w] - that was something [name] told me to do like if I'm watching TV when a commercial come on,\\9.0\\\\P\
72.0\135.0\D\1.16\3.1\Mhm\\9.0\\\\P\
73.0\136.0\P\1.16\2.1\it would help to exercise in between commercials.  \\9.0\\\\P\
73.0\137.0\P\1.16\2.11\I do that.\\9.0\\\\P\
74.0\138.0\D\1.16\3.1\Uh huh.\\9.0\\\\P\
75.0\139.0\P\1.16\2.5\I try to watch what I eat, \\9.0\\\\P\
75.0\140.0\P\1.16\2.5\drink a lot of diet - I drink diet sodas.\\9.0\\\\P\
76.0\141.0\D\1.16\3.1\Uh huh.\\9.0\\\\P\
77.0\142.0\P\1.16\2.5\I'm trying to get it down at least ten, fifteen pounds.\\9.0\\\\P\
78.0\143.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay. \\9.0\\\\P\
78.0\144.0\D\1.16\1.12\ And are you monitoring it, or how are you?\\9.0\\\\P\
79.0\145.0\P\1.16\2.11\Yes, I'm monitoring it.\\9.0\\\\P\
80.0\146.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay. \\9.0\\\\P\
80.0\147.0\D\1.16\1.12\ Now do you think it would help for you to talk to one of our dietitians here?  \\9.0\\\\R\
80.0\148.0\D\1.16\2.1\By the way, he's going to be leaving soon, \\9.0\\\\P\
80.0\149.0\D\1.16\5.1\so if you're gonna do this, we have to do it pretty soon.\\9.0\\\\P\
81.0\150.0\P\1.16\2.11\No I think I could do it.\\9.0\\\\R\3.3
82.0\151.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\P\
83.0\152.0\P\1.16\2.2\I'm pretty sure I could do it.\\9.0\\\\P\
84.0\153.0\D\1.16\5.5\Because sometimes having a diet plan is really helpful.\\9.0\\\\I\
85.0\154.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right.\\9.0\\\\I\
86.0\155.0\D\1.16\2.1\Cuz sometimes people think that you're doing the right things, \\9.0\\\\I\
86.0\156.0\D\1.16\5.5\and then finally when they talk to someone who works in this area all the time, they realize, well I guess I was not doing that right, \\9.0\\\\I\
86.0\157.0\D\1.16\5.5\and you know, it can be very helpful. \\9.0\\\\R\
86.0\158.0\D\1.16\5.5\ So we have a dietitian at least for now on site that could talk to you \\9.0\\\\P\
86.0\159.0\D\1.16\5.5\and see if there is something else that you should be doing that you're not doing.\\9.0\\\\P\
87.0\160.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right.  \\9.0\\\\P\
87.0\161.0\P\1.16\2.11\I think I could cut back on - I'll cut back on eating \\9.0\\\\P\
87.0\162.0\P\1.16\2.11\and exercising more.  \\9.0\\\\P\
87.0\163.0\P\1.16\2.2\I think I could get it down \\9.0\\\\P\
87.0\164.0\P\1.16\2.1\and keep it to a [1w] level\\9.0\\\\P\
88.0\165.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay.  \\9.0\\\\P\
88.0\166.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay. \\9.0\\\\P\
88.0\167.0\D\1.16\2.121\ Well if it doesn't - let's try, then, for a couple months, see where you are.  \\9.0\\\\P\
88.0\168.0\D\1.16\5.1\If it doesn't work, maybe you should consider that.\\9.0\\\\R\
89.0\169.0\P\1.16\6.21\Okay I will.\\9.0\\\\R\
90.0\170.0\D\1.16\1.31\Okay?\\9.0\\\\P\
91.0\171.0\P\1.16\2.13\Yes.\\9.0\\\\P\
92.0\172.0\D\1.16\1.12\We talked about this before, you remember?\\9.0\\\\P\
93.0\173.0\P\1.16\2.1\Yes\\9.0\\\\P\
94.0\174.0\D\1.16\1.12\if you have made any progress with that or not?\\9.0\\\\P\
95.0\175.0\P\1.16\2.11\Yes, cuz I watch what I eat.\\9.0\\\\P\
96.0\176.0\D\1.16\3.1\Mhm.\\9.0\\\\P\
97.0\177.0\P\1.16\2.11\And I exercise, my w\\9.0\\\\P\
98.0\178.0\D\1.16\81.0\But the way to - go ahead.\\9.0\\\\P\
99.0\179.0\P\1.16\2.1\My weight is just like staying the same.\\9.0\\\\P\
100.0\180.0\D\1.16\2.13\Right, exactly. \\9.0\\\\P\
100.0\181.0\D\1.16\2.121\ And that's that's how we're gonna have to monitor it.\\9.0\\\\P\
101.0\182.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\P\
102.0\183.0\D\1.16\2.1\It's gonna have to be for you know really the weight.  \\9.0\\\\P\
102.0\184.0\D\1.16\5.7\I mean it's good that you're changing things, \\9.0\\\\P\
102.0\185.0\D\1.16\5.7\but if the weight is not dropping, um then then you have to find another way, maybe, to help you lose that.\\9.0\\\\P\
103.0\186.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\P\
104.0\187.0\D\1.16\1.31\Okay?\\9.0\\\\P\
105.0\188.0\P\1.16\2.2\Yes.\\9.0\\\\P\
106.0\189.0\D\1.16\2.121\So it's very important that over the next two months we monitor your weight \\9.0\\\\P\
106.0\190.0\D\1.16\2.121\and you monitor weight. \\9.0\\\\P\
106.0\191.0\D\1.16\5.1\ You can even um um youknow gather one of those cheap notebooks\\9.0\\\\R\
107.0\192.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right\\9.0\\\\R\
108.0\193.0\D\1.16\5.1\from Safeway or CVS\\9.0\\\\R\
109.0\194.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right.\\9.0\\\\R\
110.0\195.0\D\1.16\5.1\And write down your weight like once a week or and see\\9.0\\\\R\
111.0\196.0\P\1.16\1.12\Cuz if I [1w] to lose like five pounds, what three pounds a week?\\9.0\\\\P\
112.0\197.0\D\1.16\2.1\It really depends on each person. \\9.0\\\\P\
112.0\198.0\D\1.16\2.1\ You don't want to lose a lot of weight very fast\\9.0\\\\P\
113.0\199.0\P\1.16\3.1\Mhm.\\9.0\\\\P\
114.0\200.0\D\1.16\2.4\Cuz that's not healthy.  \\9.0\\\\I\
114.0\201.0\D\1.16\2.1\Um You know, there're very aggressive diet plans, \\9.0\\\\I\
114.0\202.0\D\1.16\2.1\sometimes people can lose like three to five pounds to week, \\9.0\\\\I\
114.0\203.0\D\1.16\2.4\which I think it's a little too much.  \\9.0\\\\I\
114.0\204.0\D\1.16\2.4\It's better if you can lose consistently over a longer period of time.\\9.0\\\\I\
115.0\205.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\I\
116.0\206.0\D\1.16\5.1\So maybe what you can do is have a goal like over a month period to lose two or three pounds, maybe two pounds a month\\9.0\\\\R\
117.0\207.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\R\
118.0\208.0\D\1.16\5.1\And see how that goes.  \\9.0\\\\R\2.1
118.0\209.0\D\1.16\2.1\You might lose a little faster than that, a little slower than that, \\9.0\\\\P\
118.0\210.0\D\1.16\2.1\but the message is consistent weight loss over um you know over a longer period of time \\9.0\\\\P\
118.0\211.0\D\1.16\2.1\instead of you losing it too fast.\\9.0\\\\P\
119.0\212.0\P\1.16\3.1\Mhm. \\9.0\\\\P\
119.0\213.0\P\1.16\2.1\That sound right.\\9.0\\\\P\
120.0\214.0\D\1.16\2.1\But also maintaining the weight, you know once you lose it. \\9.0\\\\P\
120.0\215.0\D\1.16\2.1\ And that's that's what people find most challenging\\9.0\\\\I\
121.0\216.0\P\1.16\3.6\Okay.\\9.0\\\\I\
122.0\217.0\D\1.16\2.1\Is once you lose the weight, how I'm gonna keep that weight down.\\9.0\\\\P\
123.0\218.0\P\1.16\2.13\Right.\\9.0\\\\P\
124.0\219.0\D\1.16\1.31\Okay?\\9.0\\\\P\
