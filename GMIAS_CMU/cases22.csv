39.0\56.0\P\1.15\2.1\I do know they did a CAT scan last year \\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\57.0\P\1.15\2.1\and they said [4w] in one of my arteries.\\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\58.0\D\1.15\3.1\Oh they did?\\1.0\\\\P\

42.0\60.0\D\3.2\1.12\When did they do that?\\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\61.0\P\3.2\2.1\They did that around August - \\1.0\\\\P\

46.0\66.0\D\3.2\3.1\Mhm.\\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\67.0\P\3.2\2.1\[Name] did.\\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\68.0\D\3.2\3.1\Hmm.\\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\69.0\P\3.2\2.1\But I did get the computer printout with the scenario in one of my arteries.\\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\70.0\D\3.2\3.6\Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\71.0\D\3.2\82.0\so you - they - \\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\72.0\D\3.2\1.12\did you ever did you ever get a stress test?\\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\73.0\P\3.2\2.1\No mm mm.\\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\74.0\D\3.2\82.1\Did they do a\\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\75.0\P\3.2\2.1\[2w] did a whole in my\\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\76.0\D\3.2\2.132\What, CAT scan?\\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\77.0\P\3.2\2.1\They put you in the machine \\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\78.0\P\3.2\2.1\and [8w] in my - \\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\79.0\P\3.2\2.1\but in my [1w] over here [2w]\\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\80.0\D\3.2\2.1\Oh here you go. \\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\81.0\D\3.2\2.1\ So here's that - \\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\82.0\D\3.2\82.0\oh I see, they did a - \\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\83.0\D\3.2\2.1\you were in a study, \\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\84.0\D\3.2\1.121\and you got a CAT scan of the heart and stuff?\\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\85.0\P\3.2\2.13\Right, right, right.  That's it.\\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\86.0\D\3.2\3.6\Okay, \\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\87.0\D\1.15\3.2\so let's see - \\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\88.0\D\1.15\2.1\well actually you look pretty good, though.\\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\89.0\P\1.15\1.122\Really?\\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\90.0\D\1.15\3.6\Yeah, yeah. \\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\91.0\D\1.15\2.1\ So um you didn't really have any real blockage of your arteries at all?\\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\92.0\P\1.15\81.0\[3w]. \\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\93.0\P\1.15\1.121\ It was just [narrowing], right?\\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\94.0\D\1.15\2.13\Yeah, \\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\95.0\D\1.15\82.1\but that's\\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\96.0\P\1.15\2.132\Age? \\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\97.0\P\1.15\2.63\ [Laughs].\\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\98.0\D\1.15\3.6\Yeah, \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\99.0\D\1.12\2.1\so 50% blockage is um not - \\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\100.0\D\1.12\2.1\it's kind of normal, actually.\\1.0\\\\P\
65.0\101.0\P\1.12\2.4\I was thinking maybe that's why I [2w].\\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\102.0\D\1.12\2.431\No, I think that's probably not it, \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\103.0\D\3.0\5.1\though I would say that maybe it would be worth getting you on a treadmill \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\104.0\D\3.0\5.1\and just doing a stress test, \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\105.0\D\3.0\2.1\just to make sure that there's nothing, that's the [2w]. \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\106.0\D\5.2\2.4\ So I mean the other possibility is that you are either - that either some of the medicines you're taking are not getting along with you, \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\107.0\D\5.2\2.1\meaning the Atripla \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\108.0\D\5.2\2.1\and the Trazodone, \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\109.0\D\6.0\2.4\or you're not getting enough of them. \\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\110.0\D\6.0\2.1\ You know, I mean if you're not getting enough of the antidepressants, then you can stay tired.  \\1.0\\\\I\
66.0\111.0\D\6.0\2.1\If you're getting too much of the antidepressants, both of these medicines can make you tired\\1.0\\\\I\
67.0\112.0\P\6.0\3.1\Oh okay.\\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\113.0\D\6.0\2.2\So I don't know which the case is.\\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\114.0\P\6.0\3.6\Right, \\1.0\\\\P\
69.0\115.0\P\6.0\2.1\cuz actually as he explained it is the way it works therapeutically, like 400 milligrams [is all right].\\1.0\\\\P\
70.0\116.0\D\6.0\3.1\Yeah.\\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\117.0\P\6.0\2.1\And I'm only taking 200 milligrams.\\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\118.0\D\6.0\6.2\So I'm gonna actually talk to him about that, \\1.0\\\\R\4.1
72.0\119.0\D\6.0\2.1\because it may be that you need more Trazodone. \\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\120.0\D\6.0\2.1\ Now the - if more Trazodone makes you too tired, though\\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\121.0\P\6.0\3.1\Right.\\1.0\\\\P\
74.0\122.0\D\6.0\11.0\Then it may mean you need a different medicine completely.\\1.0\\\\P\
75.0\123.0\P\6.0\2.1\I don't even have no problem with the Trazodone.\\1.0\\\\P\
76.0\124.0\D\6.0\1.121\But it makes you sleepier?\\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\125.0\P\6.0\2.13\It makes me sleepy, \\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\126.0\P\6.0\2.1\but it don't make me too [1w] when it make me tired.\\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\127.0\D\6.0\3.6\Really? \\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\128.0\D\6.0\5.4\ So talk to him about that. \\1.0\\\\R\2.0
78.0\129.0\D\6.0\5.1\ Maybe you do need more - \\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\130.0\D\6.0\5.1\maybe if you had a little bit more - \\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\131.0\D\1.12\2.1\a lot of times, sort of a big symptom of depression is that you just can't you know you just can't get - no get up and go.\\1.0\\\\I\
79.0\132.0\P\1.12\1.121\[2w] the more depression, \\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\133.0\P\6.0\1.121\and maybe the higher dose of the Trazodone [crosstalk 2w].\\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\134.0\D\6.0\2.13\Yeah, absolutely. \\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\135.0\D\2.3\2.1\ And right after the holiday time, you know, right after Christmas, is a very frequent time when people are feeling like, you know, maybe they're actually extra depressed, or whatever.\\1.0\\\\I\
81.0\136.0\P\81.0\2.4\[2w] it could be the situation [3w].\\1.0\\\\P\
82.0\137.0\D\83.0\3.6\Yeah, \\1.0\\\\P\
82.0\138.0\D\83.0\2.1\well that may or may not help.\\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\139.0\P\81.0\2.1\It's not - they're not [4w]. \\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\140.0\P\81.0\2.4\ Maybe back in my mind it's got a lot to do with [4w].\\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\141.0\D\83.0\2.43\Sure possible.\\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\142.0\P\83.0\2.11\I talked to Dr. [name of other doctor] about that. \\1.0\\\\P\
85.0\143.0\P\1.13\1.11\ Okay [2w] my viral loads?\\2.0\hiv test rslts\3.1\P\P\

98.0\157.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Looks a little better than the last time. \\2.0\\\\R\
98.0\158.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Your T cells are up to 247\\2.0\\\\R\
99.0\159.0\P\1.13\3.6\Oh it is? \\2.0\\\\R\
99.0\160.0\P\1.13\2.12\ It went up.\\2.0\\\\R\
100.0\161.0\D\1.13\2.1\And the virus is good. \\2.0\\\\R\
100.0\162.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Virus is undetectable.\\2.0\\\\R\
101.0\163.0\P\1.13\3.6\Oh okay. \\2.0\\\\R\1.12

102.0\166.0\D\1.13\2.66\ That's good.\\2.0\\\\P\
103.0\167.0\P\1.13\3.1\Yeah.\\2.0\\\\P\
104.0\168.0\D\5.2\3.2\So . . . . . .   Let's see . . . . \\3.0\side effects\3.1\D\P\
104.0\169.0\D\5.2\1.121\So are these medicines agreeing with you okay?\\3.0\\\\P\
105.0\170.0\P\5.2\2.1\Well I'm still - it's still affects my bowel.\\3.0\\\\P\
106.0\171.0\D\5.2\3.1\Yeah.\\3.0\\\\P\
107.0\172.0\P\5.2\2.4\Cuz like I was saying, [we can't] get around that.\\3.0\\\\P\
108.0\173.0\D\5.2\2.43\Probably not, \\3.0\\\\P\
108.0\174.0\D\1.13\2.1\but the medicine's working.  \\2.0\\\\P\
108.0\175.0\D\1.13\2.1\You know, you're slowly building your T cells, \\2.0\\\\P\
108.0\176.0\D\1.13\2.1\the virus has been undetectable for awhile.  \\2.0\\\\P\
108.0\177.0\D\6.0\1.12\And then um  are you taking the Zantac for your - [you know]?\\3.0\\\\P\
109.0\178.0\P\6.0\2.1\[I'm taking one].\\3.0\\\\P\6.1
110.0\179.0\D\1.14\1.11\So - besides feeling tired, is there anything in particular that's?\\4.0\pain\3.2\P\P\
111.0\180.0\P\1.14\2.1\My main concern is extremely exhausted\\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\181.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\\1.0\\\\P\
113.0\182.0\P\1.14\11.0\All the time. \\1.0\\\\P\
113.0\183.0\P\1.14\2.1\You know And it's getting worse and worse.\\1.0\\\\P\
114.0\184.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah, and\\1.0\\\\P\
115.0\185.0\P\1.14\2.1\And I have a lot of pain around my back area.  \\4.0\\\\P\
115.0\186.0\P\1.12\1.12\Is that because of the GI problem there that\\4.0\\\\P\
116.0\187.0\D\1.12\2.431\That might not be. \\4.0\\\\P\
116.0\188.0\D\1.12\2.4\ It might be just something different.  \\4.0\\\\P\6.2
116.0\189.0\D\6.0\2.12\But sort of having extreme exhaustion sounds to me a little bit like, that maybe you would do better with more of the - you know, maybe with more of the Trazodone or something. \\1.0\\\\P\
116.0\190.0\D\6.0\5.1\ So we should definitely get [4w]. \\1.0\\\\R\
116.0\191.0\D\3.1\5.4\ Say "Ahh."\\X\\\\\
117.0\192.0\P\99.0\99.0\Ahh.\\X\\\\\

122.0\198.0\D\6.0\2.13\No no - [2w], \\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\199.0\D\6.0\2.1\but it's not gonna fix everything, \\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\200.0\D\6.0\2.4\you know I doubt it - \\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\201.0\D\6.0\2.1\it will definitely not hurt, \\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\202.0\D\6.0\82.0\but it may not fix the - \\5.0\\\\P\
122.0\203.0\D\1.14\2.14\what you're noticing is - fatigue seems to be the big problem.\\1.0\\\\P\
