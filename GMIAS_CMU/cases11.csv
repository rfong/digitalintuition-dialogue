38.0\50.0\P\1.15\11.0\Yeah.\\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\51.0\D\1.15\3.6\Ok, \\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\52.0\D\1.15\1.121\and it didn't come back the next day?\\1.0\\\\P\

41.0\54.0\D\1.15\3.6\Ok. \\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\55.0\D\1.15\1.121\And no increased phlegm, \\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\56.0\D\1.15\1.121\or anything like that?\\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\57.0\P\1.15\2.13\Nope.\\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\58.0\D\1.15\2.131\No? \\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\59.0\D\1.15\3.6\Ok. \\1.0\\\\P\5.0
43.0\60.0\D\1.14\2.121\Well, let me just pull up your old weight. \\3.0\test results\2.1\D\P\
43.0\61.0\D\1.14\3.3\So basically, um, as far as infection; \\3.0\\\\R\
43.0\62.0\D\1.12\2.14\well I mentioned to you there was quite an amount of bacteria, \\3.0\\\\R\
43.0\63.0\D\1.12\2.4\but we don't actually think it's suggestive of a real infection. \\3.0\\\\R\
43.0\64.0\D\1.15\2.1\ That bronch, the scope kind of goes through your nose, and in, you know, kind of down your\\3.0\\\\I\
44.0\65.0\P\1.15\3.1\Yeah.\\3.0\\\\I\
45.0\66.0\D\1.15\11.0\Down your windpipe, \\3.0\\\\I\
45.0\67.0\D\1.12\2.1\so sometimes there's a little bacteria there, \\3.0\\\\I\
45.0\68.0\D\1.12\2.4\and that's basically what we think, that's what's probably going on here.\\3.0\\\\R\
46.0\69.0\P\1.12\3.1\Ok.\\3.0\\\\R\
47.0\70.0\D\1.15\2.1\So far the TB tests are negative, \\3.0\\\\R\
47.0\71.0\D\1.15\82.0\they take, \\3.0\\\\I\
47.0\72.0\D\1.15\2.1\like I tell ya they'll usually keep them around for many weeks to \\3.0\\\\I\
47.0\73.0\D\1.15\2.14\'cause remember that takes awhile for that to grow, \\3.0\\\\I\
47.0\74.0\D\1.15\2.1\and there's no um fungus, \\3.0\\\\R\
47.0\75.0\D\1.15\2.4\so it's all good so far\\3.0\\\\R\
48.0\76.0\P\1.15\3.1\yeah\\3.0\\\\R\
49.0\77.0\D\1.15\11.0\that it's negative.  \\3.0\\\\R\
49.0\78.0\D\1.15\82.0\As far as the, \\3.0\\\\P\
49.0\79.0\D\1.15\3.3\I mean the other types of things we looked for are some of the, maybe abnormal cells; \\3.0\\\\P\
49.0\80.0\D\1.15\2.1\um they did not see anything really abnormal on the cells, \\3.0\\\\R\1.12
49.0\81.0\D\1.15\2.1\but sometimes, when they get to the needle like that they don't really see much anyways.\\3.0\\\\I\
50.0\82.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\3.0\\\\I\
51.0\83.0\D\1.15\2.121\So um, you know, if we need to take a look at that again, it's something that, you know, uh, they'd be classing it in a different way in the future\\3.0\\\\P\
52.0\84.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\\3.0\\\\P\
53.0\85.0\D\1.14\2.4\Um . . . so . . my feelings about this right now are I'm still concerned about your weight loss, \\3.0\\\\P\
53.0\86.0\D\1.15\5.1\and I think we need to pursue the test that we talked about before, \\3.0\\\\R\
53.0\87.0\D\82.0\82.0\and then we need to, sort of, take a\\3.0\\\\P\
54.0\88.0\\99.0\99.0\[Door closing]\\99.0\\\\\
55.0\89.0\D\1.15\5.1\If everything comes up negative, \\3.0\\\\P\
55.0\90.0\D\1.15\2.1\and so far it has, \\3.0\\\\P\
55.0\91.0\D\1.15\11.0\then I think we're gonna really need to take another look at um the chest with another CAT scan.\\3.0\\\\P\
56.0\92.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\3.0\\\\P\
57.0\93.0\D\1.15\82.0\Um, I haven't, \\3.0\\\\82.0\
57.0\94.0\D\1.15\4.0\it's a lot to put you through for, \\3.0\\\\E\
57.0\95.0\D\1.14\2.1\since you haven't really had symptoms \\3.0\\\\P\
57.0\96.0\D\1.14\2.1\and you always feel fine, \\3.0\\\\P\
57.0\97.0\D\1.14\2.4\but um the weight loss is, it's something, \\3.0\\\\P\
57.0\98.0\D\1.15\5.1\so for me it's something, it's something that I think it's important to pursue.\\3.0\\\\R\
58.0\99.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\3.0\\\\R\2.1
59.0\100.0\D\1.15\1.21\What are your thoughts about that? \\3.0\\\\E\
59.0\101.0\D\1.15\1.22\Upset about it, or\\3.0\\\\E\
60.0\102.0\P\1.15\2.4\No.\\3.0\\\\E\
61.0\103.0\D\1.15\82.0\Any\\3.0\\\\E\
62.0\104.0\P\1.15\2.4\That's fine.\\3.0\\\\E\
63.0\105.0\D\1.15\1.221\Not upset, then?\\3.0\\\\E\
64.0\106.0\P\1.15\2.4\Nope.\\3.0\\\\E\
65.0\107.0\D\1.14\82.0\How, \\82.0\\\\82.0\
65.0\108.0\D\1.14\1.12\have you been eating lately?\\4.0\3.1\APPT\D\P\
66.0\109.0\P\1.14\2.11\Yes.\\4.0\\\\P\
67.0\110.0\D\1.14\1.121\You have been?\\4.0\\\\P\
68.0\111.0\P\1.14\2.11\Yes.\\4.0\\\\P\
69.0\112.0\D\1.14\1.12\Eating well, or normal for you, or?\\4.0\\\\P\
70.0\113.0\P\1.14\2.11\Yeah normal for me.\\4.0\\\\P\
71.0\114.0\D\1.14\2.131\Normal for you. \\4.0\\\\P\
71.0\115.0\D\1.14\2.1\So you're 114 today. \\4.0\\\\P\
71.0\116.0\D\1.14\1.121\ Last time I think, I think, let's see I think you were 116?\\4.0\\\\P\
72.0\117.0\P\1.14\2.13\Mm hmm.\\4.0\\\\P\5.0
73.0\118.0\D\3.0\1.121\Oh you went to an eye doctor, I see.\\5.0\eye doc\3.1\D\P\
74.0\119.0\P\3.0\2.13\Mm hmm.\\5.0\\\\P\
75.0\120.0\D\1.14\1.11\What did they say?\\5.0\\\\P\
76.0\121.0\P\1.14\2.1\They say my um eye still the same.\\5.0\\\\P\
77.0\122.0\D\1.14\1.122\Still the same?\\5.0\\\\P\
78.0\123.0\P\1.14\2.1\Yeah.\\5.0\\\\P\
79.0\124.0\D\1.14\3.6\Ok, \\5.0\\\\P\5.0
79.0\125.0\D\3.0\3.3\so there's a, there's a, uh, there's also another thing I'd like to talk to you about, \\6.0\nodule/CAT\2.2\D\P\
79.0\126.0\D\1.0\1.11\so, anything in particular that I can, that, questions for me that you have first? \\7.0\global\3.2\P\P\
79.0\127.0\D\1.0\1.121\No?\\7.0\\\\P\
80.0\128.0\P\1.0\2.13\No.\\7.0\\\\P\
81.0\129.0\D\5.1\1.121\Things are ok with the meds?\\8.0\MEDS\3.1\P\P\
82.0\130.0\P\5.1\2.13\Yes.\\8.0\\\\P\
83.0\131.0\D\5.142\1.121\The Atripla?\\8.0\\\\P\
84.0\132.0\P\5.14\2.13\Yes.\\8.0\\\\P\
85.0\133.0\D\3.0\1.121\You have enough of them for now?\\8.0\\\\P\
86.0\134.0\P\3.0\2.13\Yes.\\8.0\\\\P\
87.0\135.0\D\3.0\3.6\Ok. Alright. \\8.0\\\\P\5.0
87.0\136.0\D\1.15\3.3\So the other thing, \\6.0\\\\P\
87.0\137.0\D\1.15\2.14\um, I don't know if you, if you remember from the last time we talked about, um, one of the reasons that I repeated the CAT scan was that you had a little nodule on the CAT scan, um last, over a year ago when you were in the hospital, \\6.0\\\\P\
87.0\138.0\D\1.15\2.14\and I wanted to see if anything had happened to that.\\6.0\\\\P\
88.0\139.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok\\6.0\\\\P\
89.0\140.0\D\1.12\2.1\Um, it actually looks exactly the same, \\6.0\\\\P\
89.0\141.0\D\1.12\2.4\which is a really good sign.\\6.0\\\\P\
90.0\142.0\P\1.12\3.1\Mm hmm.\\6.0\\\\P\
91.0\143.0\D\1.12\82.0\Um, because uh, it's less than, \\6.0\\\\P\
91.0\144.0\D\1.12\2.1\it's about a half a centimeter, \\6.0\\\\P\
91.0\145.0\D\1.12\2.1\um and usually when those things don't change over a year, usually two years, as we say, they don't change over the year\\6.0\\\\P\
92.0\146.0\P\1.12\3.1\ok\\6.0\\\\P\
93.0\147.0\D\1.12\2.1\Now the chances of them being something bad or abnormal are low. \\6.0\\\\I\
93.0\148.0\D\1.15\5.1\Still, having said that, I think that's another thing that we need to look at.  \\6.0\\\\P\
93.0\149.0\D\1.14\2.1\'Cause it's there\\6.0\\\\P\
94.0\150.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\\6.0\\\\P\
95.0\151.0\D\1.14\2.1\it was there a year ago, um when you were in the hospital, \\6.0\\\\P\
95.0\152.0\D\1.14\2.1\and it's still there now. \\6.0\\\\P\
95.0\153.0\D\3.0\6.2\ So, um, what I'm going to do about that is probably talk again. \\6.0\\\\R\
95.0\154.0\D\3.0\2.11\I actually contacted the lung doctors again, and so see whether, to see what they think we should do about that.\\6.0\\\\P\
96.0\155.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\P\
97.0\156.0\D\3.0\11.0\Planning on just kind of all lung stuff \\6.0\\\\P\
97.0\157.0\D\3.0\2.5\and I'd like to keep them involved.\\6.0\\\\P\
98.0\158.0\P\3.0\3.1\Mm hmm.\\6.0\\\\P\
99.0\159.0\D\3.0\2.11\And what I went ahead and did \\6.0\\\\P\
99.0\160.0\D\3.0\2.1\'cause sometimes it takes time to make an appointment \\6.0\\\\P\
99.0\161.0\D\3.0\2.1\and it's actually need a referral to pulmonary doctor for you. \\6.0\\\\I\
99.0\162.0\D\3.0\82.0\You could, \\6.0\\\\I\
99.0\163.0\D\3.0\2.1\we could always cancel it if we need to, \\6.0\\\\I\
99.0\164.0\D\3.0\2.1\but sometimes it takes many weeks\\6.0\\\\I\
100.0\165.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\I\
101.0\166.0\D\3.0\11.0\to get the appointment\\6.0\\\\I\
102.0\167.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\I\
103.0\168.0\D\3.0\82.0\so. Um, so what they do, \\6.0\\\\I\
103.0\169.0\D\3.0\1.22\is that ok with you if you go to the pulmonary specialist\\6.0\\\\R\
104.0\170.0\P\3.0\2.5\yeah\\6.0\\\\R\3.2
105.0\171.0\D\3.0\2.1\and you know them; \\6.0\\\\P\
105.0\172.0\D\3.0\2.12\I think you met them at Dr. [name of another doctor]'s, \\6.0\\\\P\
105.0\173.0\D\3.0\2.1\the one who did your procedure, \\6.0\\\\P\
105.0\174.0\D\3.0\2.1\he's the one I had to talk to.\\6.0\\\\P\
106.0\175.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\176.0\D\3.0\2.1\And um, she said she was gonna look at all the results, \\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\177.0\D\3.0\2.1\get back in touch with me. \\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\178.0\D\1.12\2.1\So this little nodule that you have, um, looks like it's on the right side, \\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\179.0\D\1.12\2.1\and it's kind of right here at the, at the feet, edge of the lung. \\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\180.0\D\1.15\2.11\So I actually asked her if they could get to it when they did your bronch \\6.0\\\\P\
107.0\181.0\D\1.15\2.12\but it's kind of, it kind of looks like, that you can't reach, they can't reach all the way out there\\6.0\\\\P\
108.0\182.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\183.0\D\1.15\2.1\So they freeze; \\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\184.0\D\1.15\82.0\they, if they decide that they want to go ahead and biopsy that, \\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\185.0\D\1.15\5.6\and I'm gonna leave that to, you know, I'm gonna, \\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\186.0\D\1.15\2.4\that decision is probably um best discussed between you and the lung, well the three of us, the lung doctor, me, and you, to see how to see that. \\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\187.0\D\1.15\82.0\If they're going, \\6.0\\\\P\
109.0\188.0\D\1.15\2.1\if they want a biopsy, they need to go through the chest wall.\\6.0\\\\I\
110.0\189.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\I\
111.0\190.0\D\1.15\2.1\It's more close, it's closer to there than it is\\6.0\\\\I\
112.0\191.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\\6.0\\\\I\
113.0\192.0\D\1.15\11.0\to where they can get it from the bronch. \\6.0\\\\I\
113.0\193.0\D\1.16\2.2\ So, I know you don't smoke cigarettes now; \\6.0\\\\P\
113.0\194.0\D\1.16\1.12\did you use to smoke?\\6.0\\\\P\
114.0\195.0\P\1.16\2.11\No I never.\\6.0\\\\P\
115.0\196.0\D\1.16\1.121\So you never were a smoker?\\6.0\\\\P\
116.0\197.0\P\1.16\2.11\Uh uh.\\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\198.0\D\1.16\3.6\Ok. \\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\199.0\D\1.14\3.3\And uh let's just review your family history again  any family history of, \\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\200.0\D\1.14\2.2\your father has colon cancer, I know; \\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\201.0\D\1.14\1.11\any other medical problems or cancer that run in the family?\\6.0\\\\\
118.0\202.0\P\1.14\82.0\Not that I\\6.0\\\\P\
119.0\203.0\D\1.14\1.121\Not that you know of?\\6.0\\\\P\
120.0\204.0\P\1.14\2.13\Not that I know of.\\6.0\\\\P\
121.0\205.0\D\1.14\3.6\Ok. \\6.0\\\\P\
121.0\206.0\D\1.12\4.2\So all those things make it a good sign that that nodule probably isn't anything to worry about. \\6.0\\\\P\
121.0\207.0\D\1.12\2.1\The thing that we always have to think about is it something like a cancer, \\6.0\\\\I\
121.0\208.0\D\1.15\2.1\and that's, that's why we do these tests\\6.0\\\\I\
122.0\209.0\P\1.12\3.1\uh huh\\6.0\\\\I\
123.0\210.0\D\1.12\2.1\it's something that we need to do something about.\\6.0\\\\I\
124.0\211.0\P\1.12\3.1\mhm\\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\212.0\D\1.0\2.1\Um, because of your age, \\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\213.0\D\1.0\2.1\which is young, \\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\214.0\D\1.14\2.1\that you never were smoking, \\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\215.0\D\1.14\2.1\because of staying the same over time, \\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\216.0\D\1.14\2.4\those are all good, those are all good, those are good things. \\6.0\\\\P\
125.0\217.0\D\1.12\2.71\That makes me, reassure me.\\6.0\\\\P\
126.0\218.0\P\1.12\3.1\Mm hmm.\\6.0\\\\P\
127.0\219.0\D\3.0\2.12\So um, so I think I'm gonna need a little time to talk about to the lung doctors about what they think we should do next.\\6.0\\\\P\
128.0\220.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\221.0\D\1.12\82.0\Whether they think, well this, I mean [1w] \\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\222.0\D\3.0\2.12\'cause that they might say are, "We'll wait a couple months \\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\223.0\D\1.15\2.12\and repeat the CT scan \\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\224.0\D\1.15\2.12\that way we can look at both the lymph nodes and the nodule again,' \\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\225.0\D\1.15\2.12\or they may say, "Well let's just try and take a look" \\6.0\\\\P\
129.0\226.0\D\1.15\1.22\Do you have any feelings, strong feelings either way? \\6.0\\\\E\
129.0\227.0\D\1.14\1.21\What do you think about the nodule? \\6.0\\\\E\
129.0\228.0\D\1.14\1.11\Or Any questions?\\6.0\\\\P\
130.0\229.0\P\1.14\2.1\No, no. I have no questions, now\\6.0\\\\P\
131.0\230.0\D\1.14\2.131\No questions right now? \\6.0\\\\P\
131.0\231.0\D\1.14\3.6\Ok. \\6.0\\\\P\
131.0\232.0\D\3.0\1.31\Well you know how to contact me if you need to\\6.0\\\\P\
132.0\233.0\P\3.0\2.2\yeah\\6.0\\\\P\
133.0\234.0\D\3.0\11.0\if things come up as far as questions. \\6.0\\\\P\
133.0\235.0\D\1.12\2.4\Um, none of this stuff is that emergency, that's something that has to be dealt with right now, \\6.0\\\\P\
133.0\236.0\D\3.0\2.5\but I don't want to delay any; \\6.0\\\\P\
133.0\237.0\D\3.0\2.4\it's not like anything that has to happen today or tomorrow, \\6.0\\\\P\
133.0\238.0\D\1.15\2.5\but, um, I'd like them to give me, I'd like them to give me, you know, their thoughts about getting this [2w]\\6.0\\\\P\
134.0\239.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\\6.0\\\\P\
135.0\240.0\D\1.15\2.4\I think that we need\\6.0\\\\P\
136.0\241.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\\6.0\\\\P\
137.0\242.0\D\3.0\82.0\So let me just, \\6.0\\\\P\
137.0\243.0\D\3.0\2.11\I did check this earlier today, \\6.0\\\\P\
137.0\244.0\D\3.0\2.121\but I'm gonna see if anything new came back. \\6.0\\\\P\
137.0\245.0\D\1.17\1.12\Did you get your flu shot?\\9.0\FLU SHOT\3.1\D\P\
138.0\246.0\P\1.17\2.11\Oh, no I didn't\\9.0\\\\P\
139.0\247.0\D\1.17\1.22\You wanna that today?\\9.0\\\\R\
140.0\248.0\P\1.17\6.21\I guess I could get it today.\\9.0\\\\R\
141.0\249.0\D\3.0\2.1\If you, if you like we have 'em here, so. \\9.0\\\\I\
141.0\250.0\D\3.0\5.1\Worth while you're here, you might as well so. \\9.0\\\\R\2.1
141.0\251.0\D\1.12\2.1\Um, so what they said from the, from the biopsy is done, nondiagnostic, \\3.0\\\\R\
141.0\252.0\D\1.12\2.1\and what they means is, it means they don't, it doesn't, you don't have cancer, basically, \\3.0\\\\R\
141.0\253.0\D\1.12\2.1\but it, very few cells are in there \\3.0\\\\R\
141.0\254.0\D\1.12\2.1\so it doesn't [3w]. \\3.0\\\\R\
141.0\255.0\D\3.0\3.3\But, and the other stuff we already talked about. \\3.0\\\\R\
141.0\256.0\D\3.0\2.2\Um, I don't know if we went over this last time \\10.0\stool test\2.1\D\R\
141.0\257.0\D\1.15\2.1\but your stool tests came back with no blood\\10.0\\\\\
142.0\258.0\P\1.15\3.1\yeah\\10.0\\\\\
143.0\259.0\D\1.15\2.66\so that's all good stuff. . . . . \\10.0\\\\\
143.0\260.0\D\1.15\3.3\So which leaves just two other things to talk about, \\2.0\\\\A\
143.0\261.0\D\1.15\2.5\um, one is the colonoscopy I wanted to talk [3w], \\11.0\colonoscopy\2.1\D\P\
143.0\262.0\D\1.15\1.121\but I think we definitely discussed this on the phone about the prostate, right?\\11.0\\\\P\
144.0\263.0\P\1.15\2.13\Mm hmm.\\11.0\\\\P\
145.0\264.0\D\1.15\2.14\And we discussed the colonoscopy also. \\11.0\\\\P\
145.0\265.0\D\1.15\1.21\So any further thoughts about whether you'd be willing to undergo a colonoscopy?\\11.0\\\\P\
146.0\266.0\P\1.15\2.2\Uh, I don't know \\11.0\\\\P\
146.0\267.0\P\1.15\2.63\[chuckles].\\11.0\\\\P\
147.0\268.0\D\1.15\1.221\You're not sure?\\11.0\\\\P\
148.0\269.0\P\1.15\2.2\Not sure.\\11.0\\\\P\
149.0\270.0\D\1.15\82.0\What is, what is it about it that\\11.0\\\\P\
150.0\271.0\P\1.15\2.2\Just not sure.\\11.0\\\\P\
151.0\272.0\D\1.15\1.221\You're just not sure if you want to do it?\\11.0\\\\P\
152.0\273.0\P\1.15\2.2\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\P\
153.0\274.0\D\1.15\1.31\Do you understand the reasons for wanting to do it? \\11.0\\\\P\
153.0\275.0\D\1.15\1.31\For me, you know, for us, maybe wanting to do it? \\11.0\\\\P\
153.0\276.0\D\1.14\2.1\Um . . It has to do with your family history, \\11.0\\\\P\
153.0\277.0\D\1.14\2.1\and basically the enough weight loss.\\11.0\\\\P\
154.0\278.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mm.\\11.0\\\\P\
155.0\279.0\D\1.15\1.22\So. . . . . . . . so if I were to recommend it for you, I mean, would you, would you be able to think about it? \\11.0\\\\P\
155.0\280.0\D\1.15\1.22\Would you agree to it? \\11.0\\\\P\
155.0\281.0\D\1.15\1.22\Do you want to go along with it, or is it not at all?\\11.0\\\\P\
156.0\282.0\P\1.15\81.0\[4w] time to decide\\11.0\\\\P\
157.0\283.0\D\1.15\1.221\You, you would like to do it?\\11.0\\\\R\
158.0\284.0\P\1.15\2.5\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\R\
159.0\285.0\D\1.15\3.6\Ok. \\11.0\\\\P\
159.0\286.0\D\1.15\2.4\You seem a little hesitant\\11.0\\\\P\
160.0\287.0\P\1.15\2.63\[chuckles]\\11.0\\\\P\
161.0\288.0\D\1.15\1.31\but, do you know how, do you know, you know what this test consists of?\\11.0\\\\I\
162.0\289.0\P\1.15\2.2\Um somewhat\\11.0\\\\I\
163.0\290.0\D\1.15\1.31\so what do you know?\\11.0\\\\I\
164.0\291.0\P\1.15\2.2\Um I think I know somewhat, \\11.0\\\\I\
164.0\292.0\P\1.15\82.0\but it's uh\\11.0\\\\I\
165.0\293.0\D\1.15\2.1\Usually what they do is, they kind of make you drink some, \\11.0\\\\I\
165.0\294.0\D\1.15\2.1\it depends from persontoperson [2w] \\11.0\\\\I\
165.0\295.0\D\1.15\2.1\but you drink something to kind of make you go to the bathroom, and try to clean yourself out\\11.0\\\\I\
166.0\296.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\\11.0\\\\I\
167.0\297.0\D\1.15\2.1\and then you just sort of stick a scope in \\11.0\\\\I\
167.0\298.0\D\1.15\2.1\and then they, they go through the rectum, \\11.0\\\\I\
167.0\299.0\D\1.15\2.1\and they take a look at the colon, \\11.0\\\\I\
167.0\300.0\D\1.15\82.0\and if anything, \\11.0\\\\I\
167.0\301.0\D\1.15\2.1\basically it's kind of like they're getting a video\\11.0\\\\I\
168.0\302.0\P\1.15\2.1\Oh yeah, I [4w].\\11.0\\\\P\
169.0\303.0\D\1.15\1.121\You had a colonoscopy done?\\11.0\\\\P\
170.0\304.0\P\1.15\2.1\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\P\
171.0\305.0\D\3.0\1.12\Was it here?\\11.0\\\\P\
172.0\306.0\P\3.0\2.12\Mm hmm, yeah. I think, Mm\\11.0\\\\P\
173.0\307.0\D\3.0\82.0\Do you, were you, \\11.0\\\\P\
173.0\308.0\D\3.0\1.121\when you were in a hospital?\\11.0\\\\P\
174.0\309.0\P\1.15\2.1\Not um, I think I had that thing before with that camera, \\11.0\\\\P\
174.0\310.0\P\1.15\2.1\um, 'cause then Dr. [name of another doctor] did it.\\11.0\\\\P\
175.0\311.0\D\1.15\2.2\Oh you had a sigmoidoscopy. \\11.0\\\\P\
175.0\312.0\D\3.0\2.2\Ok, yes, you did have it, in um twothousand \\11.0\\\\P\
175.0\313.0\D\1.15\2.1\and, well you had the one that goes in about halfway\\11.0\\\\P\
176.0\314.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\315.0\D\1.15\5.3\Basically now you usually just do the one that goes the whole way, \\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\316.0\D\1.15\82.0\because you have a, \\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\317.0\D\1.15\2.1\you know, we have better techniques, \\11.0\\\\I\
177.0\318.0\D\1.15\5.1\and um kind of like if your gonna do half, you kind of might as well do the whole thing, \\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\319.0\D\3.0\2.14\and so you did have it in 2001, \\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\320.0\D\1.14\2.14\and you had some hemorrhoids, um, at that time. \\11.0\\\\P\
177.0\321.0\D\1.14\1.121\You were having bleeding at that time, correct?\\11.0\\\\P\
178.0\322.0\P\1.14\2.1\A little bit then.\\11.0\\\\P\
179.0\323.0\D\1.14\2.131\A little bit. \\11.0\\\\P\
179.0\324.0\D\3.0\2.14\So, um, that was about five years ago, \\11.0\\\\P\
179.0\325.0\D\3.0\1.121\and you haven't really gone back since, right? \\11.0\\\\P\
179.0\326.0\D\1.14\82.0\You haven't needed to. . . . . \\11.0\\\\P\
179.0\327.0\D\1.14\1.121\And it never came back after?\\11.0\\\\P\
180.0\328.0\P\1.14\2.13\no.\\11.0\\\\P\
181.0\329.0\D\1.15\82.0\So, that's some, \\11.0\\\\P\
181.0\330.0\D\1.15\1.31\so basically you kind of, now you've had now, so you know what I'm talking about now.\\11.0\\\\P\
182.0\331.0\P\1.15\2.2\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\P\
183.0\332.0\D\1.15\1.22\Would you be willing to go through that again?\\11.0\\\\P\
184.0\333.0\P\82.0\82.0\'Cause I, um, 'cause I think my, that's my, \\11.0\\\\P\
184.0\334.0\P\3.0\2.1\that's sent me a letter to um do it about checkups.\\11.0\\\\P\
185.0\335.0\D\3.0\1.121\Dr. [name of another doctor]?\\11.0\\\\P\
186.0\336.0\P\3.0\2.13\Mm hmm.\\11.0\\\\P\
187.0\337.0\D\1.15\2.1\So he's, well he'll, he looks for, at the, at the anal area, for you know, any changes or warts \\11.0\\\\P\
187.0\338.0\D\1.15\2.1\but that's different \\11.0\\\\P\
187.0\339.0\D\3.0\2.1\it's sort of, it's a GI doctor, \\11.0\\\\I\
187.0\340.0\D\3.0\2.1\they're different doctors\\11.0\\\\I\
188.0\341.0\P\3.0\3.1\ok\\11.0\\\\I\
189.0\342.0\D\3.0\11.0\than the colonoscopy.\\11.0\\\\I\
190.0\343.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\11.0\\\\I\
191.0\344.0\D\1.15\1.22\So. . . . . so if you're ok with, in agreement with that I'll, you know, go ahead and make that order.\\11.0\\\\R\
192.0\345.0\P\1.15\6.21\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\R\
193.0\346.0\D\1.15\1.221\You are?\\11.0\\\\R\
194.0\347.0\P\1.15\2.5\Yeah.\\11.0\\\\R\
195.0\348.0\D\1.15\3.6\Ok. \\11.0\\\\R\2.1
195.0\349.0\D\1.14\3.3\Um, and then the final thing, that I wanted to discuss with you would be, um, the prostate, \\12.0\prostate\2.1\D\P\
195.0\350.0\D\1.15\1.31\and I, remember when we discussed how you come in to do blood work?\\12.0\\\\P\
196.0\351.0\P\1.15\2.2\Mm hmm.\\12.0\\\\P\
197.0\352.0\D\1.15\1.121\I'm not sure if you had it done?\\12.0\\\\P\
198.0\353.0\P\1.15\2.11\I had, I had my [8w].\\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\354.0\D\1.15\3.2\Yeah, \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\355.0\D\1.15\2.121\not gonna be able to have it for you today; \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\356.0\D\1.15\82.0\um basically your CAT scan um, \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\357.0\D\1.15\2.1\you know how [5w] CAT scan works \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\358.0\D\1.15\2.1\and um the nodule \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\359.0\D\1.15\2.1\and then it's just show a slightly enlarged prostate for someone of your age, \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\360.0\D\1.15\2.1\um, it's big, \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\361.0\D\1.15\81.0\but [5w] \\12.0\\\\P\
199.0\362.0\D\1.15\5.1\but I think it's probably a good idea for us to check that out. \\12.0\\\\R\
199.0\363.0\D\1.15\2.121\Um, so what we we need to do, what we need to do is close enough\\12.0\\\\R\
200.0\364.0\P\1.15\3.1\uh huh\\12.0\\\\R\
201.0\365.0\D\1.15\2.121\and the rectal exam, \\12.0\\\\R\
201.0\366.0\D\3.0\2.1\which I do in the clinic, \\12.0\\\\I\
201.0\367.0\D\1.15\2.121\and I'll do the blood test. \\12.0\\\\R\2.1
201.0\368.0\D\1.15\82.0\I don't, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\369.0\D\1.15\2.121\I need to do the blood first, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\370.0\D\1.15\2.121\because if I do the rectal exam now, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\371.0\D\3.0\2.121\and then send you downstairs, sometimes they can actually, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\372.0\D\1.15\2.121\I'll get the results from the blood test, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\373.0\D\1.15\6.12\so I won't do it out right now, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\374.0\D\1.15\2.121\but what I'll do is try to get that blood work today, \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\375.0\D\3.0\2.121\and then um probably need to see you back pretty soon \\12.0\\\\P\
201.0\376.0\D\3.0\81.0\so we can [2w] the following [1w].\\12.0\\\\P\
202.0\377.0\\99.0\99.0\[Door closes].\\12.0\\\\99.0\
203.0\378.0\D\3.0\2.121\But I I'll see you today \\12.0\\\\P\
203.0\379.0\D\81.0\2.121\so we can figure out what's on [3w].\\12.0\\\\P\
204.0\380.0\P\3.0\3.1\Ok.\\12.0\\\\P\
205.0\381.0\D\3.0\3.4\So. So we're off. \\12.0\\\\P\
205.0\382.0\D\1.14\1.11\Do you have any questions about the prostate?\\12.0\\\\P\
206.0\383.0\P\1.14\2.1\Mm mm.\\12.0\\\\P\
207.0\384.0\D\1.0\1.11\Or about anything in general?\\7.0\\\\P\
208.0\385.0\P\1.0\2.1\No.\\7.0\\\\P\
209.0\386.0\D\3.0\3.2\Um. . . \\7.0\\\\P\5.0
