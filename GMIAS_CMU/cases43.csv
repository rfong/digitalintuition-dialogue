48.0\63.0\P\1.13\2.132\Last time -\3.0\4.0\\\\P\
49.0\64.0\D\1.13\2.131\Last time, right? \3.0\4.0\\\\P\
49.0\65.0\D\1.13\3.2\Ok so you could see here, \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
49.0\66.0\D\1.13\2.11\um I graphed it for you so you could see -\11.0\4.0\\\\P\
50.0\67.0\P\1.13\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
51.0\68.0\D\1.13\2.1\the Tcell is doing much, much better\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
52.0\69.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
53.0\70.0\D\1.13\2.1\it was 642 last time -\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
54.0\71.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
55.0\72.0\D\1.13\2.14\So the date was 10/23/2006, the last time you were here.\11.0\4.0\\\\P\
56.0\73.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
57.0\74.0\D\1.13\2.1\So you could see that, um, it went up very well -\12.0\4.0\\\\P\
58.0\75.0\P\1.13\2.66\Oh good.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
59.0\76.0\D\1.13\2.1\And not only that, it seems to be higher than you've been in years, years, years.\16.0\4.0\\\\P\
60.0\77.0\P\1.13\2.2\I know. Ok.\3.0\4.0\\\\P\
61.0\78.0\D\11.0\11.0\Ok? \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
61.0\79.0\D\1.13\2.12\I think this one, in 2004, when it was 47\10.0\4.0\\\\P\
62.0\80.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
63.0\81.0\D\11.0\11.0\I said I told you I think it was in error\11.0\4.0\\\\P\
64.0\82.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
65.0\83.0\D\1.13\82.1\because I think when we repeated it -\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
66.0\84.0\P\1.13\2.132\Yeah, then it went up again yeah, ok -\9.0\4.0\\\\P\
67.0\85.0\D\1.13\2.1\Yeah, it was your regular, \5.0\4.0\\\\P\
67.0\86.0\D\1.13\2.4\I think this was an error -\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
68.0\87.0\P\1.13\2.43\It was in error, yes, ok.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
69.0\88.0\D\1.13\2.12\Either they missed a number\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
70.0\89.0\P\1.13\2.12\or something\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
71.0\90.0\D\1.13\2.12\or they didn't add a number \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
71.0\91.0\D\1.13\2.12\or something like that, yeah.\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
72.0\92.0\P\1.13\2.12\Yeah, maybe it's 337? 47?\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
73.0\93.0\D\1.13\2.43\Maybe, \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
73.0\94.0\D\1.13\2.12\or 447?  \2.0\4.0\\\\P\
73.0\95.0\D\1.13\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
74.0\96.0\P\1.13\3.1\yeah\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
75.0\97.0\D\1.13\2.2\We don't know how it works. \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
75.0\98.0\D\1.13\2.1\So anyway, it's going up again -\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
76.0\99.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
77.0\100.0\D\1.13\2.1\And it's, like, higher than ever.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
78.0\101.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
79.0\102.0\D\5.11\1.121\The only thing is here, Um I don't know if, like, you skipped like a couple of days -\19.0\5.0\ADHERENCE\4.21\D\P\
80.0\103.0\P\5.11\2.11\That's true -\3.0\5.0\\\\P\
81.0\104.0\D\82.0\82.0\Because it was like?\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
82.0\105.0\P\5.11\2.11\Yesterday I didn't get to.\5.0\5.0\\\\P\
83.0\106.0\D\1.13\2.1\Because it was 140.\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
84.0\107.0\P\1.13\3.1\oh\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
85.0\108.0\D\5.12\5.5\So you have to be very careful \7.0\5.0\\\\P\
85.0\109.0\D\1.13\2.1\because this is considered what we call a blip, \9.0\5.0\\\\P\
85.0\110.0\D\1.13\2.121\so I need to repeat this next month when you come -\12.0\5.0\\\\R\2.1
86.0\111.0\P\1.13\3.1\Ok.\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
87.0\112.0\D\1.13\2.14\because you could see you've been undetectable -\8.0\5.0\\\\P\
88.0\113.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
89.0\114.0\D\11.0\11.0\Since 2003.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
90.0\115.0\P\1.13\2.13\All this time, yeah.\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
91.0\116.0\D\1.13\2.1\So although the Tcell is rising up -\8.0\5.0\\\\P\
92.0\117.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
93.0\118.0\D\1.13\2.1\things are doing better \4.0\5.0\\\\P\
93.0\119.0\D\1.13\2.1\but the viral load jump from -\7.0\5.0\\\\P\
94.0\120.0\P\1.13\3.6\Jump from.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
95.0\121.0\D\1.13\82.1\Yeah you see the -\5.0\5.0\\\\P\
96.0\122.0\P\1.13\81.0\[4w].\1.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\123.0\D\1.13\2.1\Mm hmm, mm hmm 150. \5.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\124.0\D\1.13\2.1\It's still, if you look at it undetectable \8.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\125.0\D\1.13\2.1\less than 400, \3.0\5.0\\\\P\
97.0\126.0\D\1.13\2.14\it's still undetectable -\4.0\5.0\\\\P\
98.0\127.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
99.0\128.0\D\1.13\2.1\But the thing is, you can see the difference.\9.0\5.0\\\\P\
100.0\129.0\P\1.13\3.6\alright. Ok.\2.0\5.0\\\\P\
101.0\131.0\D\1.13\3.3\The other thing I wanted to show you is this number, the CD4 percentage? \14.0\4.0\TEST RESULT\4.22\D\P\
101.0\132.0\D\1.13\2.1\You could see that it's also going up.\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
101.0\130.0\D\1.13\3.4\Mhm, Ummm. \2.0\5.0\\\\P\
102.0\133.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
103.0\134.0\D\1.13\2.1\So that's one of the reasons why the Tcell is building up higher.\13.0\4.0\\\\I\
104.0\135.0\P\1.13\3.1\mm hmm.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
105.0\136.0\D\1.13\3.2\Ok, \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
105.0\137.0\D\1.15\3.3\If we go down, your white count? \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
105.0\138.0\D\1.15\82.1\That's the one we check for um -\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
106.0\139.0\P\1.15\1.121\Anemia?\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
107.0\140.0\D\1.15\2.13\no no no \3.0\4.0\\\\I\
107.0\141.0\D\1.15\2.1\for infection\2.0\4.0\\\\I\
108.0\142.0\P\1.15\3.6\oh ok.\2.0\4.0\\\\I\
109.0\143.0\D\1.15\2.1\and that was normal. \4.0\4.0\\\\P\
109.0\144.0\D\1.15\2.1\ This is the one for anemia, hemoglobin \7.0\4.0\\\\I\
109.0\145.0\D\1.15\2.1\hematocrit. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
109.0\146.0\D\1.15\2.1\That was very good also\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
110.0\147.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
111.0\148.0\D\1.15\2.1\and your platelet count was 219, \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
111.0\149.0\D\1.15\2.1\so you could see on the screen. You've never really had a platelet problem.\14.0\4.0\\\\P\
112.0\150.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
113.0\151.0\D\11.0\11.0\Ok? \1.0\4.0\\\\P\

114.0\153.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
115.0\154.0\D\1.15\2.14\And you've been always in the range of that. \9.0\4.0\\\\P\5.0
115.0\155.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um, the other thing is the sugar was 64, \9.0\6.0\SUGAR\4.22\D\P\
115.0\156.0\D\1.15\2.1\just a little bit low, \5.0\6.0\\\\P\
115.0\157.0\D\1.15\2.12\but I don't think that one came from you -\10.0\6.0\\\\P\

120.0\162.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\6.0\\\\R\
121.0\163.0\D\1.15\2.1\What happens is the sugar sits on the bottom sometimes, \10.0\6.0\\\\R\
121.0\164.0\D\1.15\2.1\and if you don't shake it enough -\8.0\6.0\\\\R\
122.0\165.0\P\1.15\3.6\Oh.\1.0\6.0\\\\R\

142.0\193.0\D\1.15\2.1\0.7\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
142.0\194.0\D\1.15\2.1\and 12.\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
143.0\195.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
144.0\196.0\D\1.15\2.1\So this number usually it's very good to monitor, \9.0\8.0\\\\I\
144.0\197.0\D\1.15\2.1\especially if you're on the medication.\6.0\8.0\\\\I\
145.0\198.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
146.0\199.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um, It's, certain people, \4.0\8.0\\\\I\
146.0\200.0\D\1.15\2.2\I know you don't \4.0\8.0\\\\I\
146.0\201.0\D\11.0\11.0\but a certain people will have diabetes\7.0\8.0\\\\I\
147.0\202.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
148.0\203.0\D\1.15\2.1\certain people will have problems with high blood pressure, \9.0\8.0\\\\I\
148.0\204.0\D\1.15\2.4\it's very important to check this number.\7.0\8.0\\\\I\
149.0\205.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
150.0\206.0\D\1.15\2.1\This number is what some of us look at, \9.0\8.0\\\\I\
150.0\207.0\D\1.15\2.1\like if a person is to go on dialysis -\10.0\8.0\\\\I\
151.0\208.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\8.0\\\\I\
152.0\209.0\D\11.0\11.0\This is the number -\5.0\8.0\\\\I\
153.0\210.0\P\1.15\3.6\Oh ok\2.0\8.0\\\\I\
154.0\211.0\D\1.15\2.1\the Creatinine\2.0\8.0\\\\I\
155.0\212.0\P\1.15\2.1\I see the dial -\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
156.0\213.0\D\1.15\2.131\You see that, right? Yeah. \5.0\8.0\\\\P\
156.0\214.0\D\1.15\82.0\So what happens is, if this number goes up, \9.0\8.0\\\\I\
156.0\215.0\D\1.15\2.1\and people who have bad kidneys\6.0\8.0\\\\I\
157.0\216.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mhm\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
158.0\217.0\D\1.15\2.1\if it goes up to, like, 6, 7, 8, ok?\10.0\8.0\\\\I\
159.0\218.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
160.0\219.0\D\11.0\11.0\Then that's when people require dialysis.\6.0\8.0\\\\I\
161.0\220.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
162.0\221.0\D\1.15\2.1\So you could see, if I graph it for you, you've never been higher than 0.7, 0.9.\17.0\8.0\\\\P\
163.0\222.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
164.0\223.0\D\1.15\2.1\So this is a very important number, \7.0\8.0\\\\I\
164.0\224.0\D\1.15\2.1\the creatinine needs monitor. \4.0\8.0\\\\I\
164.0\225.0\D\1.15\2.1\This one also, this one shouldn't go higher than 20.\10.0\8.0\\\\I\
165.0\226.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
166.0\227.0\D\1.15\2.1\If it's higher than 20 there's a problem of dehydration.\10.0\8.0\\\\I\
167.0\228.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
168.0\229.0\D\1.15\2.1\So we have to hydrate you \6.0\8.0\\\\I\
168.0\230.0\D\1.15\2.1\and um check your kidneys. \5.0\8.0\\\\I\5.0
168.0\231.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um, the other test was this one, \7.0\9.0\LIVER\4.22\D\P\
168.0\232.0\D\1.15\2.1\which was very good.  \4.0\9.0\\\\P\
168.0\233.0\D\1.15\2.1\The ALT/AST for your liver\5.0\9.0\\\\P\
169.0\234.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
170.0\235.0\D\11.0\11.0\was totally normal, \3.0\9.0\\\\P\
170.0\236.0\D\1.15\2.1\it's not even above 20\5.0\9.0\\\\P\
171.0\237.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
172.0\238.0\D\1.15\2.1\so the ALT was 16 \5.0\9.0\\\\P\
172.0\239.0\D\1.15\2.1\and the AST was 20. \5.0\9.0\\\\P\
172.0\240.0\D\1.15\2.1\So that's the liver test \5.0\9.0\\\\P\
172.0\241.0\D\1.15\2.1\which turned out to be excellent.\6.0\9.0\\\\P\
173.0\242.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\
174.0\243.0\D\1.15\2.1\This one too, this is another important number, bilirubin\9.0\9.0\\\\I\
175.0\244.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\9.0\\\\I\
176.0\245.0\D\1.15\2.1\That's the one, when people have liver disease or not liver disease we look and, \15.0\9.0\\\\I\
176.0\246.0\D\1.15\1.121\I don't know if you see some people in your hospital -\12.0\9.0\\\\P\
177.0\247.0\P\1.15\2.132\Yellow.\1.0\9.0\\\\P\

180.0\250.0\D\1.15\2.1\That's because this number is higher than, like, 4, 5, 6, 7, \12.0\9.0\\\\I\
180.0\251.0\D\1.15\2.1\there are certain people who have, like, 10, 11, 12\10.0\9.0\\\\I\
181.0\252.0\P\1.15\2.64\wow\1.0\9.0\\\\I\

210.0\300.0\D\1.15\2.1\hemoglobin \1.0\11.0\\\\I\
210.0\301.0\D\1.15\2.1\hematocrit, right?\2.0\11.0\\\\I\
211.0\302.0\P\1.15\3.6\hematocrit yes\2.0\11.0\\\\I\
212.0\303.0\D\1.15\11.0\Those are the things we watch for. \7.0\11.0\\\\I\
212.0\304.0\D\1.15\2.1\So you could see, over here. Ok. Alright. \8.0\11.0\\\\P\
212.0\305.0\D\1.15\2.1\12.7\1.0\11.0\\\\P\
212.0\306.0\D\1.15\2.1\and 37.8, \2.0\11.0\\\\P\
212.0\307.0\D\1.15\2.1\just, like, one point lower than the one before\9.0\11.0\\\\P\
213.0\308.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\11.0\\\\P\
214.0\309.0\D\1.15\2.1\But nothing major.\3.0\11.0\\\\P\
215.0\310.0\P\1.15\1.122\no?\1.0\11.0\\\\P\
216.0\311.0\D\1.15\2.14\And I told you about the platelet count, \8.0\11.0\\\\P\
216.0\312.0\D\1.15\2.1\so it's not only the hemoglobin \6.0\11.0\\\\I\
216.0\313.0\D\1.15\2.1\hematocrit you watch for, \4.0\11.0\\\\I\
216.0\314.0\D\1.15\2.1\you also gotta watch out for the platelet, \8.0\11.0\\\\I\
216.0\315.0\D\1.15\2.14\and that's the one I told you from 150 to 350\11.0\11.0\\\\I\
217.0\316.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
218.0\317.0\D\1.15\2.1\we always gotta monitor, \4.0\11.0\\\\I\
218.0\318.0\D\1.15\2.14\and I showed you you never have a problem with that. \11.0\11.0\\\\I\
218.0\319.0\D\1.15\2.1\ Now this number, if it goes lower than 50\9.0\11.0\\\\I\
219.0\320.0\P\1.15\3.1\hm\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
220.0\321.0\D\1.15\11.0\that's when certain people, like if they have liver disease \10.0\11.0\\\\I\
220.0\322.0\D\1.15\2.1\or severe anemia, that's when sometime we have to give them platelet.\12.0\11.0\\\\I\
221.0\323.0\P\1.15\3.6\platelet ok\2.0\11.0\\\\I\
222.0\324.0\D\1.15\2.1\This number, this is the number we monitor, the hemoglobin, \10.0\11.0\\\\I\
222.0\325.0\D\1.15\2.1\if it's lower than, if it's, if it's lower than 8 we worry. \13.0\11.0\\\\I\
222.0\326.0\D\1.15\2.1\If it's at 7, we consider um umblood transfusion\9.0\11.0\\\\I\
223.0\327.0\P\1.15\3.1\oh\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
224.0\328.0\D\1.15\2.1\and if it's at 6 it's considered very dangerous, \9.0\11.0\\\\I\
224.0\329.0\D\1.15\2.1\and some people get shortness of breath \7.0\11.0\\\\I\
224.0\330.0\D\1.15\2.1\and a lot of, you know, bad stuff\8.0\11.0\\\\I\
225.0\331.0\P\1.15\3.1\yeah\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
226.0\332.0\D\1.15\2.1\you become pale\3.0\11.0\\\\I\
227.0\333.0\P\1.15\3.1\oh yeah\2.0\11.0\\\\I\
228.0\334.0\D\1.15\3.2\Ok, so, \2.0\11.0\\\\I\
228.0\335.0\D\1.15\2.1\but for you it's normal it's fine. \7.0\11.0\\\\I\
228.0\336.0\D\1.15\2.1\But I just wanted to show you these numbers are very very important.\13.0\11.0\\\\I\
229.0\337.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
230.0\338.0\D\1.15\2.1\So when we do the blood work we check for all that.\12.0\11.0\\\\I\
231.0\339.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\11.0\\\\I\
232.0\340.0\D\1.15\2.14\Now the other one, um before we got frozen \9.0\10.0\CHOLESTEROL\\\P\
232.0\341.0\D\1.15\2.63\[chuckles] \1.0\10.0\\\\P\
232.0\342.0\D\11.0\11.0\was the cholesterol -\4.0\10.0\\\\P\
233.0\343.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\10.0\\\\P\
234.0\344.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um 186, \2.0\10.0\\\\P\
234.0\345.0\D\1.15\2.1\that's very very good. Right? \5.0\10.0\\\\P\
234.0\346.0\D\1.15\2.1\'Cause that's the number you don't want above 200.\9.0\10.0\\\\I\
235.0\347.0\P\1.15\1.121\When you saw above 200 it's bad, right?\8.0\10.0\\\\I\
236.0\348.0\D\1.15\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\10.0\\\\I\
236.0\349.0\D\1.15\2.1\that means you have high cholesterol, and -\8.0\10.0\\\\I\
237.0\350.0\P\1.15\3.6\Oh yes.\2.0\10.0\\\\I\
238.0\351.0\D\1.15\2.1\I have to teach people how to eat better\9.0\10.0\\\\I\
239.0\352.0\P\1.15\3.1\mhm\1.0\10.0\\\\I\
240.0\353.0\D\11.0\11.0\what to do, um, in terms of their eating habits. \10.0\10.0\\\\I\
240.0\354.0\D\1.15\2.1\Now the other number that's important, you see here it says cholesterol, HDL ratio?\14.0\10.0\\\\I\
241.0\355.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\10.0\\\\I\
242.0\356.0\D\1.15\2.1\That's very important, \3.0\10.0\\\\I\
242.0\357.0\D\1.15\2.1\for you it's 3, \4.0\10.0\\\\P\
242.0\358.0\D\1.15\2.1\it's perfect.\2.0\10.0\\\\P\
243.0\359.0\P\1.15\3.1\Ok.\1.0\10.0\\\\P\
244.0\360.0\D\1.15\2.1\Um, if you have a man, um that has this number higher than 5 -\15.0\10.0\\\\I\
245.0\361.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\10.0\\\\I\
246.0\362.0\D\11.0\11.0\You have to worry, \4.0\10.0\\\\I\
246.0\363.0\D\1.15\2.1\because this number higher than 5 can lead to heart disease.\11.0\10.0\\\\I\
247.0\364.0\P\1.15\3.6\Oh.\1.0\10.0\\\\I\
248.0\365.0\D\1.15\3.2\Mm hmm. \2.0\10.0\\\\I\
248.0\366.0\D\1.15\2.1\So it's, a lot of times some people, some doctors, they only look into the cholesterol, \16.0\10.0\\\\I\
248.0\367.0\D\1.15\2.1\but it's not only the cholesterol, \6.0\10.0\\\\I\
248.0\368.0\D\1.15\2.1\it's the whole, \3.0\10.0\\\\I\
248.0\369.0\D\1.15\2.1\see where it says here, lipid profile?\7.0\10.0\\\\I\
249.0\370.0\P\1.15\3.1\Mm hmm.\2.0\10.0\\\\I\

433.0\660.0\P\5.2\2.4\But I think the medication [4w].\6.0\20.0\MEDS REL TO LEG\\\P\
434.0\661.0\D\5.2\2.43\I, I don't disagree with that, though.\7.0\20.0\\\\P\

436.0\663.0\D\5.2\2.1\Yeah, because sometimes it does happen -\7.0\20.0\\\\I\
437.0\664.0\P\5.2\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\20.0\\\\I\
438.0\665.0\D\11.0\11.0\Um, what we call um, um muscle atrophy. \8.0\20.0\\\\I\

439.0\667.0\P\5.2\1.121\But it's nothing to [2w] or something.\7.0\20.0\\\\P\
440.0\668.0\D\5.31\5.1\Well the other thing to consider is changing the medication, \10.0\20.0\\\\R\
440.0\669.0\D\5.31\5.1\changing something like Epzicom, \4.0\20.0\\\\R\
440.0\670.0\D\5.31\2.1\because Epzicom has the Ziagen in it, \7.0\20.0\\\\I\
440.0\671.0\D\5.31\2.1\the yellow pill -\4.0\20.0\\\\I\

442.0\673.0\D\5.31\2.121\To see if there's a difference. \6.0\20.0\\\\R\
442.0\674.0\D\5.31\2.1\But you've also got to consider, to get you to the number we got you\15.0\20.0\\\\R\
443.0\675.0\P\5.31\2.2\I know\2.0\20.0\\\\R\

448.0\680.0\D\1.13\3.2\Well what I consider is, let's see, \7.0\20.0\\\\R\4.4
448.0\681.0\D\1.13\5.1\just in case if the viral gets to, like 1,000 -\11.0\20.0\\\\I\

455.0\689.0\P\1.13\3.1\mm\1.0\20.0\\\\I\
456.0\690.0\D\5.31\5.1\And if that happens, then from the genotype we can probably pick and choose -\15.0\20.0\\\\P\
457.0\691.0\P\5.31\3.1\Ok.\1.0\20.0\\\\P\
458.0\692.0\D\11.0\11.0\What is something that's not gonna -\7.0\20.0\\\\P\
459.0\693.0\P\5.31\3.1\Ok.\1.0\20.0\\\\P\
