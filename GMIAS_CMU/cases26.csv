13.0\19.0\P\3.0\2.14\You got me that appointment. \1.0\\\\P\
13.0\20.0\P\3.0\2.11\ I had to reschedule it for the optometrist, \1.0\\\\P\

19.0\27.0\P\3.0\2.121\And they uh are going to fit me with some glasses.\1.0\\\\P\
20.0\28.0\D\3.0\3.6\Yep.  Okay.\1.0\\\\P\
21.0\29.0\P\1.0\2.4\Other than that, I'm good.  \1.0\\\\P\
21.0\30.0\P\1.0\2.4\I need to be able to see things \1.0\\\\P\
21.0\31.0\P\1.14\2.4\because when it comes to small print\1.0\\\\P\
22.0\32.0\D\1.14\3.1\yeah\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\33.0\P\11.0\11.0\I'm like what used to be here, I'm like\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\34.0\D\83.0\83.0\Way \1.0\\\\P\
24.0\35.0\D\1.0\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\36.0\P\1.0\2.1\I'm getting older.\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\37.0\D\1.0\3.2\Yeah, well, you know what um, \1.0\\\\P\
26.0\38.0\D\1.0\2.1\people hit the age of 40 and that's pretty common.\1.0\\\\P\
27.0\39.0\P\1.0\2.1\Yeah, I'm 49, \1.0\\\\P\
27.0\40.0\P\1.0\2.1\I'll be 50 August the 6th.\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\41.0\D\1.0\2.12\You've actually held if off for a little longer.\1.0\\\\P\
29.0\42.0\P\1.0\3.6\Yeah, yeah, actually. \1.0\\\\P\
29.0\43.0\P\1.0\2.2\ I think too, also, it had a lot to do with the fact that maybe I didn't really know either \1.0\\\\P\
29.0\44.0\P\1.0\2.1\because I didn't have a whole lot to read all the time.\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\45.0\D\1.0\3.1\ok\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\46.0\P\1.0\3.2\You know. \1.0\\\\P\
31.0\47.0\P\1.0\2.4\And so that always, things change \1.0\\\\P\
31.0\48.0\P\1.0\2.4\because you know, of not being able to do other things\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\49.0\D\1.0\3.1\yeah\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\50.0\P\11.0\11.0\and if I had something to do with my condition. \1.0\\\\P\
33.0\51.0\P\1.0\2.4\ I'm more susceptible to them not being so physical as I was before \1.0\\\\P\
33.0\52.0\P\1.0\2.4\which means that I'm using my brain more\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\53.0\D\1.0\3.1\ok\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\54.0\P\1.0\2.11\so I read more \1.0\\\\P\
35.0\55.0\P\1.14\2.4\and I definitely need to gain \1.0\\\\P\
35.0\56.0\P\1.14\2.4\and visualize \1.0\\\\P\
35.0\57.0\P\1.14\2.4\and see what I'm reading. \1.0\\\\P\
35.0\58.0\P\1.14\2.11\ I go to church and I'm in church \1.0\\\\P\
35.0\59.0\P\1.14\2.4\and sometimes, you know, you have, sometimes the lighting may not be as much as you would like, high enough for you\1.0\\\\P\
36.0\60.0\D\1.14\3.1\right\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\61.0\P\1.14\11.0\in certain parts of the church where you would be seated, \1.0\\\\P\
37.0\62.0\P\1.14\2.4\so I would probably have to have glasses to be able to focus. \1.0\\\\P\
37.0\63.0\P\1.14\2.11\ So I, you know, you get those little glasses you buy at the store for just reading?\1.0\\\\P\
38.0\64.0\D\1.14\3.1\ok\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\65.0\P\1.14\2.11\I put them on like spectacles or something.\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\66.0\D\1.14\1.12\Yeah, and it works for you?\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\67.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yeah, it works, \1.0\\\\P\
41.0\68.0\P\1.14\2.5\but I'm gonna need real glasses \1.0\\\\P\
41.0\69.0\P\1.14\2.2\because I can see where my vision has been impaired.  \1.0\\\\P\
41.0\70.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's changing.\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\71.0\D\1.14\3.2\Yeah, well, also, you know, I mean, \1.0\\\\P\
42.0\72.0\D\1.14\3.7\you mentioned this yourself, \1.0\\\\P\
42.0\73.0\D\1.14\2.1\good lighting is very important when you are reading.\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\74.0\P\1.14\3.6\Yeah, extremely. \1.0\\\\P\
43.0\75.0\P\1.14\2.4\ If I am in the dark with this type of print\1.0\\\\P\
44.0\76.0\D\1.14\3.1\mhm\1.0\\\\P\
45.0\77.0\P\1.14\11.0\for this size of print for me would be difficult to read.\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\78.0\D\1.14\3.1\Right.\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\79.0\P\1.14\2.4\I would have to have, you know, a pair of glasses.\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\80.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\81.0\P\1.14\3.1\Umhum.\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\82.0\D\1.14\3.1\All right. \1.0\\\\P\5.0
50.0\83.0\D\5.1\1.21\ And how are things going with the medication?\2.0\meds\3.1\D\P\
51.0\84.0\P\5.1\2.4\Great. \2.0\\\\P\
51.0\85.0\P\1.14\2.4\ I feel good. \3.0\mood\2.1\P\P\
51.0\86.0\P\1.14\3.7\ I, as I said to you before, \3.0\\\\P\
51.0\87.0\P\1.16\2.4\the better the weather, the better I am \3.0\\\\P\
51.0\88.0\P\1.16\2.1\because I can do more physical stuff\3.0\\\\P\
52.0\89.0\D\1.16\3.1\ok\3.0\\\\P\
53.0\90.0\P\1.16\2.11\and so I've been able to walk \3.0\\\\P\
53.0\91.0\P\1.16\2.11\and maybe a little light jog or\3.0\\\\P\
54.0\92.0\D\1.16\3.1\right\3.0\\\\P\
55.0\93.0\P\1.16\11.0\things of that nature to try to keep myself active.\3.0\\\\P\
56.0\94.0\D\1.16\5.7\That's great, \3.0\\\\P\
56.0\95.0\D\4.0\8.0\excuse me, I'm sorry. \T\\\\\
56.0\96.0\D\4.0\8.0\ One minute. \T\\\\\
56.0\97.0\D\99.0\99.0\[answers phone] [Physician Name].  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  Um, so you couldn't do, so could I order it for a week before this? That would be great and then she and I can discuss it when I see her.  Okay, so if you could, yeah, that's fine and actually if you want to schedule her for five weeks instead of a month and then have her do the labs at four weeks, that would be perfect.  Okay, that's fine.  I'll read it. Okay.  Thanks so much.  Just a couple that I want the results so that we can talk about them when she comes in.  Okay.  Uh, yeah, except for the genotype probably, yeah it will probably be all right.  Great, thanks so much.  Okay, bye, bye.  [hangs up the phone] \99.0\\\\\
56.0\98.0\D\4.0\8.0\Sorry, [Name of patient].\T\\\\\
57.0\99.0\P\4.0\8.0\That's all right.\T\\\\\
58.0\100.0\D\1.16\2.14\So you were telling me about exercise \3.0\\\\P\
58.0\101.0\D\1.16\2.14\and feeling good \3.0\\\\P\
58.0\102.0\D\1.16\2.14\and getting out a little bit.\3.0\\\\P\
59.0\103.0\P\2.3\2.4\Yeah, it helps with my inner self \3.0\\\\P\
59.0\104.0\P\2.3\2.4\it's been great with things for me to involve myself with \3.0\\\\P\
59.0\105.0\P\2.3\2.4\because, you know, we do have, it's always a down side  this thing. \3.0\\\\P\
59.0\106.0\P\2.3\2.4\ You know, nobody is going to be super up all the time.\3.0\\\\P\
60.0\107.0\D\2.3\2.13\Right.\3.0\\\\P\
61.0\108.0\P\2.3\2.4\So this helps enable me to keep the right attitude \3.0\\\\P\
61.0\109.0\P\2.3\2.4\and the right, I guess you could say uh settled for everything in terms of my feelings \3.0\\\\P\
61.0\110.0\P\2.3\2.4\and I'm doing pretty good, yeah.\3.0\\\\P\
62.0\111.0\D\2.3\82.1\yeah I mean\3.0\\\\P\
63.0\112.0\P\2.3\2.4\Like I don't feel like I'm full with doubt and hostility or anything.\3.0\\\\P\
64.0\113.0\D\2.3\3.6\Okay, good.  \3.0\\\\P\
64.0\114.0\D\2.3\2.4\Yeah, we are all going to have our good days and our bad days.\3.0\\\\P\
65.0\115.0\P\2.3\3.6\Yeah, absolutely. \3.0\\\\P\
65.0\116.0\P\2.3\2.4\ You can't get around it.\3.0\\\\P\
66.0\117.0\D\2.3\3.6\Yeah, exactly.\3.0\\\\P\
67.0\118.0\P\2.3\2.4\And even for the most healthiest person.\3.0\\\\P\
68.0\119.0\D\2.3\2.43\That's absolutely true.  \3.0\\\\P\
68.0\120.0\D\2.3\5.4\So, um, you know um, keep that in mind \3.0\\\\P\
68.0\121.0\D\2.3\2.121\and if there is anything you have to deal with that's okay.\3.0\\\\P\
69.0\122.0\P\2.3\3.1\mhm\3.0\\\\P\
70.0\123.0\D\2.3\5.4\But if they start to get a couple in a row or anything like that, then let us know \3.0\\\\P\
70.0\124.0\D\2.3\2.121\and we'll talk about stuff.\3.0\\\\P\
71.0\125.0\P\2.3\3.1\Right, \3.0\\\\P\
71.0\126.0\P\2.3\2.2\people focus on that \3.0\\\\P\
71.0\127.0\P\2.3\2.5\and yeah, I want to make sure you know, \3.0\\\\P\
71.0\128.0\P\2.3\2.5\I'm not going to try to, you know, disregard it. \3.0\\\\P\
71.0\129.0\P\2.3\2.5\ I'll just approach it with the right approach\3.0\\\\P\
72.0\130.0\D\2.3\3.1\yup\3.0\\\\P\
73.0\131.0\P\2.3\11.0\and deal with it accordingly. \3.0\\\\P\
73.0\132.0\P\2.3\83.0\ But I do tend to have a, there be no spurts. \3.0\\\\P\
73.0\133.0\P\2.3\2.1\ I have a way of, I guess you could say, dealing with it.\3.0\\\\P\
74.0\134.0\D\2.3\3.1\uh huh\3.0\\\\P\
75.0\135.0\P\2.3\2.1\I don't try to involve anybody else in it when I feel it coming on \3.0\\\\P\
75.0\136.0\P\2.3\2.1\I have way of doing it where I can just do something to combat it\3.0\\\\P\
76.0\137.0\D\2.3\3.1\ok\3.0\\\\P\
77.0\138.0\P\2.8\2.1\and pray \3.0\\\\P\
77.0\139.0\P\1.16\2.1\and a few other physical things that I might do to, \3.0\\\\P\
77.0\140.0\P\1.16\2.1\like exercise or whatever.\3.0\\\\P\
78.0\141.0\D\1.16\3.1\ok\3.0\\\\P\
79.0\142.0\P\2.3\2.1\I'm totally not exempt from having them.\3.0\\\\P\
80.0\143.0\D\2.3\3.1\Right\3.0\\\\P\
81.0\144.0\P\2.3\2.1\because I have them\3.0\\\\P\
82.0\145.0\D\2.3\3.6\Right, exactly.\3.0\\\\P\
83.0\146.0\P\2.3\2.1\I do. \3.0\\\\P\
83.0\147.0\P\2.3\2.4\Mine, most importantly is not that, I guess you can say that uh severe\3.0\\\\P\
84.0\148.0\D\2.3\3.1\mhm\3.0\\\\P\
85.0\149.0\P\2.3\2.4\because it is what it is \3.0\\\\P\
85.0\150.0\P\2.3\2.1\and I have come to terms with what it is. \3.0\\\\P\
85.0\151.0\P\2.3\2.1\ So I have way of probably dealing with it better than most, you know?\3.0\\\\P\
86.0\152.0\D\2.3\2.42\Okay, I think it's great that you developed ways to\3.0\\\\P\
87.0\153.0\P\2.3\3.1\yeah\3.0\\\\P\
88.0\154.0\D\2.3\11.0\to handle things, \3.0\\\\P\
88.0\155.0\D\2.3\5.1\but I also don't want you to not ask for help.\3.0\\\\R\
89.0\156.0\P\2.3\3.6\No, no.\3.0\\\\R\
90.0\157.0\D\2.3\11.0\If it gets to that point.\3.0\\\\R\
91.0\158.0\P\81.0\81.0\No, I'm not, I'm not, no [3w].\3.0\\\\R\2.1
92.0\159.0\D\2.3\3.6\Right, \3.0\\\\P\
92.0\160.0\D\2.8\1.121\and to know that, it sounds like your church you are very involved in. \3.0\\\\P\
92.0\161.0\D\2.4\1.121\ I am sure there are people there that you can reach out to.\3.0\\\\P\
93.0\162.0\P\2.4\2.13\Absolutely, yeah.\3.0\\\\P\
94.0\163.0\D\2.4\1.121\Family or friends, \3.0\\\\P\

99.0\169.0\P\2.3\2.4\Oh yeah, yeah.\3.0\\\\P\
100.0\170.0\D\2.3\1.22\Thoughts of hurting yourself or other people?\3.0\\\\P\

101.0\172.0\P\2.3\2.4\I'm not a violent guy. \3.0\\\\P\
101.0\173.0\P\2.0\2.4\ I can take care of myself. \3.0\\\\P\
101.0\174.0\P\1.0\83.0\ I have myself where I used to box.\3.0\\\\P\
102.0\175.0\D\1.0\3.1\Okay.\3.0\\\\P\

105.0\179.0\P\2.0\2.1\because of my age \3.0\\\\P\
105.0\180.0\P\2.8\2.3\and because of my faith.\3.0\\\\P\
106.0\181.0\D\2.0\3.1\mhm\3.0\\\\P\
107.0\182.0\P\2.3\2.4\I'm a lot more carrying \3.0\\\\P\
107.0\183.0\P\2.4\2.4\and more sensitive to other people \3.0\\\\P\
107.0\184.0\P\2.3\2.4\and I'm not as aggressive as I used to be\3.0\\\\P\
108.0\185.0\D\2.3\3.1\yeah\3.0\\\\P\
109.0\186.0\P\2.3\3.7\to be honest with you.  \3.0\\\\P\
109.0\187.0\P\2.0\2.1\I used to be very aggressive physically\3.0\\\\P\
110.0\188.0\D\2.0\3.1\yeah\3.0\\\\P\
111.0\189.0\P\2.0\3.7\and uh, I guess you would say for those who know that world\3.0\\\\P\

265.0\418.0\P\1.14\2.1\It might be a little short \2.0\\\\P\
265.0\419.0\P\1.14\2.2\because I'm focusing on this \2.0\\\\P\
265.0\420.0\P\1.14\2.1\and then my chest feels like my heart is contracting or something\2.0\\\\P\

271.0\426.0\P\1.14\2.1\The grabbing doesn't last as long, \2.0\\\\P\
271.0\427.0\P\83.0\83.0\I feel that goes extreme of pain.\2.0\\\\P\

288.0\453.0\D\1.14\1.12\does it go into your jaw \2.0\\\\P\
288.0\454.0\D\1.14\1.12\or into your arm?\2.0\\\\P\
289.0\455.0\P\2.8\2.3\No, thank God.  \2.0\\\\P\
289.0\456.0\P\1.14\2.61\That's what I was concerned with\2.0\\\\P\
290.0\457.0\D\1.14\3.1\ok\2.0\\\\P\
291.0\458.0\P\81.0\81.0\cause you know, I'm not only in  my [1w] not going through my throat \2.0\\\\P\
291.0\459.0\P\83.0\83.0\or my face or nothing. \2.0\\\\P\
291.0\460.0\P\1.14\2.1\ It's just right there in that area.\2.0\\\\P\
292.0\461.0\D\1.14\3.1\ok\2.0\\\\P\
293.0\462.0\P\1.16\2.11\So I eat a lot of eggs, \2.0\\\\P\
293.0\463.0\P\1.16\1.11\is that good?  \2.0\\\\P\
293.0\464.0\P\83.0\83.0\Cause I'm taking, \2.0\\\\P\
293.0\465.0\P\83.0\83.0\I thought I always\2.0\\\\P\
294.0\466.0\D\1.16\3.1\ok\2.0\\\\P\
295.0\467.0\P\83.0\83.0\try to take the best way possible, \2.0\\\\P\
295.0\468.0\P\83.0\83.0\you know what could be, \2.0\\\\P\
295.0\469.0\P\83.0\83.0\maybe I'm thinking, \2.0\\\\P\
295.0\470.0\P\1.16\2.2\I try to think is it, you know too much cholesterol\2.0\\\\P\
296.0\471.0\D\1.16\3.6\right right\2.0\\\\P\
297.0\472.0\P\2.0\2.2\maybe or you know, I don't know. \2.0\\\\P\
297.0\473.0\P\2.0\2.1\ I'm just trying, \2.0\\\\P\
297.0\474.0\P\2.0\2.5\I always want to find reasons\2.0\\\\P\
298.0\475.0\D\2.0\3.1\yeah\2.0\\\\P\
299.0\476.0\P\2.0\11.0\for having to know that it's something else \2.0\\\\P\
299.0\477.0\P\2.0\2.4\and not something to be really that worried about.\2.0\\\\P\
300.0\478.0\D\2.0\3.1\ok\2.0\\\\P\
301.0\479.0\P\2.0\2.2\Try to remember all that I'm doing.\2.0\\\\P\
302.0\480.0\D\2.0\3.6\Absolutely, \2.0\\\\P\
302.0\481.0\D\1.14\2.12\so it sounds to me um like it is isolated to the times when you are taking your pills.\2.0\\\\P\
303.0\482.0\P\1.14\2.43\Mhm.  Maybe, maybe, yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
304.0\483.0\D\1.14\1.121\And it clears within two hours, right?\2.0\\\\P\
305.0\484.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right.\2.0\\\\P\
306.0\485.0\D\1.14\1.122\And it's never occurred at other times of the day.\2.0\\\\P\
307.0\486.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yes, ma'am.\2.0\\\\P\
308.0\487.0\D\1.14\1.122\And it does not, from what you are telling me, occur when you are exercising?\2.0\\\\P\
309.0\488.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yes, ma'am.\2.0\\\\P\
310.0\489.0\D\1.14\2.2\So all those things make me think it's less likely that it's your heart.\2.0\\\\R\
311.0\490.0\P\1.14\2.66\great\2.0\\\\R\
312.0\491.0\D\1.14\4.0\ok?\2.0\\\\R\
313.0\492.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\2.0\\\\R\
314.0\493.0\D\1.14\1.12\Do you ever feel like your heart is racing \2.0\\\\P\
314.0\494.0\D\1.14\1.12\or skipping a beat?\2.0\\\\P\
315.0\495.0\P\1.14\2.4\Mmmm, it feels the same all, \2.0\\\\P\
315.0\496.0\P\1.14\82.1\it's not the, what you say\2.0\\\\P\
316.0\497.0\D\1.14\1.122\Palpitation?\2.0\\\\P\
317.0\498.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right, right.\2.0\\\\P\
318.0\499.0\D\1.14\2.2\Okay, so what I think it is, is that although you maybe feeling it on your left, \2.0\\\\R\
318.0\500.0\D\1.14\2.4\it maybe more that the pills as they are going down \2.0\\\\R\
318.0\501.0\D\1.14\2.4\it's more your esophagus or your feeding tube.\2.0\\\\R\
319.0\502.0\P\1.14\3.6\Oh.\2.0\\\\R\
320.0\503.0\D\1.14\1.22\Ok? \2.0\\\\R\
320.0\504.0\D\1.14\2.2\ And I think that maybe what's going on. \2.0\\\\R\1.1
320.0\505.0\D\1.14\5.7\ And I think it's great that you are drinking lots of water.\2.0\\\\P\
321.0\506.0\P\5.4\3.3\Let me ask you this while we talking about it.\2.0\\\\I\
322.0\507.0\D\5.4\3.6\yeah\2.0\\\\I\
323.0\508.0\P\5.4\5.1\Why don't we cut these pills in half for, \2.0\\\\I\
323.0\509.0\P\5.4\2.121\as long as I take all of them, \2.0\\\\I\
323.0\510.0\P\5.4\2.5\just for the sake of swallowing. \2.0\\\\I\
323.0\511.0\P\5.4\2.4\ Cause they are pretty big pills.\2.0\\\\I\
324.0\512.0\D\5.4\1.121\So  some of them are capsules though, right?\2.0\\\\I\
325.0\513.0\P\5.4\2.13\No, they all pills.\2.0\\\\I\
326.0\514.0\D\82.0\82.1\The, the, the\2.0\\\\I\
327.0\515.0\P\5.4\2.1\Everything is a pill \2.0\\\\I\
327.0\516.0\P\5.4\2.1\and they are all in the football shape. \2.0\\\\I\
327.0\517.0\P\5.4\2.14\ They have the blue ones, \2.0\\\\I\
327.0\518.0\P\5.4\1.121\which is the Truvada, right?\2.0\\\\I\
328.0\519.0\D\5.4\2.13\Right, that's  a pill.\2.0\\\\I\
329.0\520.0\P\5.4\2.1\Which is a smaller football.\2.0\\\\I\
330.0\521.0\D\5.4\3.1\Yep, yep.\2.0\\\\I\
331.0\522.0\P\5.4\2.14\And than you have the Sustiva.\2.0\\\\I\
332.0\523.0\D\5.4\3.1\Yep.\2.0\\\\I\
333.0\524.0\P\5.4\2.14\And you have the Kaletra \2.0\\\\I\
333.0\525.0\P\5.4\82.1\all, which are\2.0\\\\I\
334.0\526.0\D\5.4\2.14\Oh, that's right, Kaletra's are tablets now.\2.0\\\\I\
335.0\527.0\P\5.4\2.13\Yeah, yes, ma'am.\2.0\\\\I\
336.0\528.0\D\5.4\3.6\Ok.  \2.0\\\\I\
336.0\529.0\D\5.4\2.2\You know what, I don't know the answer to that question.\2.0\\\\I\
337.0\530.0\P\5.4\3.1\Yes, ma'am.\2.0\\\\I\
338.0\531.0\D\3.3\6.3\So what we can do is I can call the pharmacist.  \2.0\\\\R\
338.0\532.0\D\3.3\6.2\Um, I'll send the pharmacist an email.\2.0\\\\R\
339.0\533.0\P\3.3\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\4.1
340.0\534.0\D\5.4\1.21\So how does that sound.\2.0\\\\P\
341.0\535.0\P\5.4\2.51\I was supposed to take up the dosage today.\2.0\\\\P\
342.0\536.0\D\3.3\5.3\Well, you know what, when you go down there\2.0\\\\P\
343.0\537.0\P\5.4\3.1\mhm\2.0\\\\P\
344.0\538.0\D\11.0\11.0\ask them at the window.\2.0\\\\P\
345.0\539.0\P\3.3\1.122\at the prescription window?\2.0\\\\P\
346.0\540.0\D\3.3\2.13\Yeah, you ask them at the window \2.0\\\\P\
346.0\541.0\D\3.3\5.3\and then you do that \2.0\\\\P\
346.0\542.0\D\3.3\6.2\and I will also call one of the pharmacists and ask her.\2.0\\\\R\
347.0\543.0\P\3.3\3.6\Yes, ma'am.\2.0\\\\R\
348.0\544.0\D\11.0\11.0\And ask her what she thinks about it.\2.0\\\\R\
349.0\545.0\P\5.4\3.6\Great.\2.0\\\\R\
350.0\546.0\D\5.4\3.6\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
351.0\547.0\P\5.4\2.4\That would be perfect.\2.0\\\\R\
352.0\548.0\D\83.0\83.0\But you do think you are having a little trouble getting, \2.0\\\\P\
352.0\549.0\D\83.0\83.0\because of the size of the pills?\2.0\\\\P\
353.0\550.0\P\83.0\83.0\They, just is might be right on with the pills are huge.\2.0\\\\P\
354.0\551.0\D\5.4\3.6\I know\2.0\\\\P\
355.0\552.0\P\5.4\3.3\Now, let me tell you this, \2.0\\\\P\
355.0\553.0\P\5.4\3.7\you know, as you well know, \2.0\\\\P\
355.0\554.0\P\5.4\2.14\the Sustiva, I think, is the very smallest one.\2.0\\\\I\
356.0\555.0\D\5.4\2.1\Umhum, here I have a picture.\2.0\\\\I\
357.0\556.0\P\5.4\2.14\And then the size of the Truvada would be the next size \2.0\\\\I\
357.0\557.0\P\5.4\2.14\and then of course Kaletra, the bigger, that's the gold pill.\2.0\\\\I\
358.0\558.0\D\5.4\2.13\Yes, that's the Kaletra.\2.0\\\\I\
359.0\559.0\P\5.4\2.14\And it's the biggest pill.\2.0\\\\I\
360.0\560.0\D\5.4\2.13\Yep, and here's the Truvada.\2.0\\\\I\
361.0\561.0\P\5.4\2.14\And you see how small the Sustiva is.  \2.0\\\\I\
361.0\562.0\P\5.4\2.14\That's the smallest one \2.0\\\\I\
361.0\563.0\P\5.4\2.14\and the second smallest is Truvada, it's correct \2.0\\\\I\
361.0\564.0\P\5.4\2.4\and um, the Kaletra, it's a very, very big pill to swallow.\2.0\\\\I\
362.0\565.0\D\5.4\2.1\Okay, it used to be even bigger.\2.0\\\\I\
363.0\566.0\P\5.4\2.64\Wow.  \2.0\\\\I\
363.0\567.0\P\5.4\2.63\[laughs]\2.0\\\\I\

391.0\610.0\P\1.16\2.4\because you don't want to you know, be in that situation and\5.0\\\\P\
392.0\611.0\D\1.16\2.43\Right, \5.0\\\\P\
392.0\612.0\D\1.16\82.1\and not be able to uh\5.0\\\\P\
393.0\613.0\P\81.0\81.0\I have got that more fear with my [2w] condition than anything.\5.0\\\\P\
394.0\614.0\D\2.3\1.122\The fear of not being able to perform?\5.0\\\\P\
395.0\615.0\P\2.3\2.13\That \5.0\\\\P\
395.0\616.0\P\2.3\2.1\and the problem that comes along with that\5.0\\\\P\
396.0\617.0\D\2.3\3.1\Okay.\5.0\\\\P\
397.0\618.0\P\82.0\82.0\the severity of illness. \5.0\\\\P\
397.0\619.0\P\83.0\83.0\ Sometimes more serious than mine \5.0\\\\P\
397.0\620.0\P\83.0\83.0\because I see that everyone that I've seen that have had that problem.\5.0\\\\P\
398.0\621.0\D\1.1\1.122\You are talking about prostate cancer?\5.0\\\\P\
399.0\622.0\P\1.1\2.13\Yeah, yep, yep.\5.0\\\\P\
400.0\623.0\D\1.16\82.1\Okay, so cause the pomegranate juice that we are talking about \5.0\\\\I\
400.0\624.0\D\1.16\82.0\it sounds like two different, \5.0\\\\I\
400.0\625.0\D\1.16\1.121\we are talking about two things, right?\5.0\\\\I\
401.0\626.0\P\1.16\2.13\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
402.0\627.0\D\1.16\2.1\One is that pomegranate juice has been shown, \5.0\\\\I\
402.0\628.0\D\1.16\3.7\not in any truly scientific studies, but \5.0\\\\I\
402.0\629.0\D\1.16\11.0\to improve male sexual function.\5.0\\\\I\
403.0\630.0\P\1.16\2.13\No! \5.0\\\\I\
403.0\631.0\P\1.16\2.1\ I'm talking about that it helps with the problem of prostate.\5.0\\\\I\
404.0\632.0\D\1.16\3.1\Okay.\5.0\\\\I\
405.0\633.0\P\1.16\3.2\Yeah, your prostate. \5.0\\\\I\
405.0\634.0\P\1.16\2.1\ It says it helps strength the possibility of your prostate enlarging.\5.0\\\\I\
406.0\635.0\D\1.16\3.1\Right, right.\5.0\\\\I\
407.0\636.0\P\1.16\1.12\is that it?  \5.0\\\\I\
407.0\637.0\P\1.16\2.13\Yeah\5.0\\\\I\
408.0\638.0\D\1.0\82.1\So men, as they get older.\5.0\\\\I\
409.0\639.0\P\1.16\2.4\I'm not worried about that other thing right now.\5.0\\\\I\
410.0\640.0\D\1.16\3.6\ok,  all right.\5.0\\\\I\
411.0\641.0\P\1.16\2.4\I'm not really that really wild anymore. \5.0\\\\P\
411.0\642.0\P\1.16\2.4\  I'm very conservative\5.0\\\\P\
412.0\643.0\D\1.16\3.1\ok\5.0\\\\P\
413.0\644.0\P\1.16\11.0\I have to say. \5.0\\\\P\
413.0\645.0\P\1.16\2.4\ It's probably because it's going along with age too.\5.0\\\\P\
414.0\646.0\D\1.16\3.1\Yeah, yeah.\5.0\\\\P\
415.0\647.0\P\1.16\3.2\but anyway\5.0\\\\P\
416.0\648.0\D\1.0\2.14\So the prostate actually fits around the urethra \5.0\\\\I\
416.0\649.0\D\1.0\2.14\which is the tube where your urine comes out.\5.0\\\\I\
417.0\650.0\P\1.0\3.6\Right, \5.0\\\\I\
417.0\651.0\P\1.14\2.14\you know I had pressure on my urethra.\5.0\\\\P\
418.0\652.0\D\1.14\2.14\Right, you had that truck accident.\5.0\\\\P\
419.0\653.0\P\1.14\2.131\That truck accident.\5.0\\\\P\
420.0\654.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\5.0\\\\P\
421.0\655.0\P\8.0\2.1\And they had to give me a cystoscopy you know \5.0\\\\P\
421.0\656.0\P\8.0\2.1\and I was catherized and all of that, yeah.\5.0\\\\P\
422.0\657.0\D\1.0\2.14\So, um, and African American men are at increased risk for prostate cancer.\5.0\\\\I\
423.0\658.0\P\1.0\2.13\Right, that's what I've been talking about.\5.0\\\\I\
424.0\659.0\D\1.16\2.43\So you are right on the money here with your concern\5.0\\\\I\
425.0\660.0\P\1.16\3.1\yeah\5.0\\\\I\
426.0\661.0\D\1.16\2.4\and I think it's important.\5.0\\\\I\
427.0\662.0\P\1.16\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
428.0\663.0\D\1.16\3.2\Um, and I think that uh, \5.0\\\\I\
428.0\664.0\D\1.16\83.0\what we can do is that there are a couple ways that we have for that.\5.0\\\\R\
429.0\665.0\P\83.0\83.0\Right.\5.0\\\\R\
430.0\666.0\D\83.0\83.0\And keep on top that, on top of it.\5.0\\\\R\
431.0\667.0\P\1.16\1.122\That's what you thought I was talking about \5.0\\\\R\
431.0\668.0\P\1.16\2.63\ [laughs]\5.0\\\\R\
432.0\669.0\D\1.17\3.2\So what we do is, \5.0\\\\R\
432.0\670.0\D\1.17\2.121\um we'll do an exam\5.0\\\\R\
433.0\671.0\P\1.17\82.0\the prostate\5.0\\\\R\
434.0\672.0\D\1.17\2.1\and the exam is a digital rectal exam.\5.0\\\\R\
435.0\673.0\P\1.17\2.1\I've done that\5.0\\\\R\
436.0\674.0\D\1.17\82.1\So um, what that means is they physically, \5.0\\\\I\
436.0\675.0\D\1.17\2.14\right, it's an exam where a finger is used to insert into the rectum.\5.0\\\\I\
437.0\676.0\P\81.0\81.0\[crosstalk 10w] \5.0\\\\81.0\
437.0\677.0\P\1.17\2.2\I understand everything.\5.0\\\\I\
438.0\678.0\D\1.17\2.1\And then the other thing is there is a blood test \5.0\\\\I\
438.0\679.0\D\1.17\2.1\and it's called a prostate specific antigen or a PSA test\5.0\\\\I\
439.0\680.0\P\1.17\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
440.0\681.0\D\1.17\2.1\now there is some controversy over it's use \5.0\\\\I\
440.0\682.0\D\1.17\2.1\and how good a screening test it really is.\5.0\\\\I\
441.0\683.0\P\81.0\81.0\[2w] mhm\5.0\\\\I\
442.0\684.0\D\1.17\3.6\Okay. \5.0\\\\I\
442.0\685.0\D\1.17\5.1\ Um, so what happens whenever you do a test is you need to think about what you are doing to do next.\5.0\\\\I\
443.0\686.0\P\3.0\1.12\So what doctor would I have to see for that?\5.0\\\\I\
444.0\687.0\D\3.0\1.122\The blood test \5.0\\\\I\
444.0\688.0\D\3.0\1.122\or the exam?\5.0\\\\I\
445.0\689.0\P\3.0\1.12\The exam.\5.0\\\\I\
446.0\690.0\D\3.0\6.3\I can do the exam.\5.0\\\\I\
447.0\691.0\P\3.0\2.5\Hopefully, I would stay with you. \5.0\\\\I\
447.0\692.0\P\3.0\2.4\ I am comfortable with that.\5.0\\\\I\
448.0\693.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay.  \5.0\\\\I\
448.0\694.0\D\3.0\6.3\I can do that \5.0\\\\I\
448.0\695.0\D\3.0\6.3\and I can do the blood test if you want to.\5.0\\\\R\
449.0\696.0\P\3.0\2.4\I would prefer it.  \5.0\\\\R\
449.0\697.0\P\81.0\81.0\[crosstalk 5w]\5.0\\\\81.0\
450.0\698.0\D\1.17\3.2\Okay, so what I want you to know is, okay, \5.0\\\\I\
450.0\699.0\D\1.17\2.4\what I want you to know about the blood test though is that it does not always, \5.0\\\\I\
450.0\700.0\D\1.17\3.2\like I said, \5.0\\\\I\
450.0\701.0\D\11.0\11.0\it's not a great test\5.0\\\\I\
451.0\702.0\P\1.17\3.1\yeah ok\5.0\\\\I\
452.0\703.0\D\1.17\2.1\okay, so sometimes it's positive\5.0\\\\I\
453.0\704.0\P\1.17\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
454.0\705.0\D\1.17\2.12\and that means we need to think about the next step \5.0\\\\I\
454.0\706.0\D\3.0\2.121\which would mean me referring you to a urologist\5.0\\\\I\
455.0\707.0\P\3.0\3.1\mhm\5.0\\\\I\
456.0\708.0\D\3.0\2.1\who would be a prostate doctor \5.0\\\\I\
456.0\709.0\D\3.0\2.12\who would then probably want to do a procedure on you.\5.0\\\\I\
457.0\710.0\P\1.14\2.1\Because of this accident, I had to see a urologist \5.0\\\\P\
457.0\711.0\P\1.14\2.1\and they had tested me before\5.0\\\\P\
458.0\712.0\D\1.14\3.1\ok\5.0\\\\P\
459.0\713.0\P\1.14\2.1\but that's been a while since the accident, \5.0\\\\P\
459.0\714.0\P\1.14\2.1\so I don't know.\5.0\\\\P\
460.0\715.0\D\1.14\3.1\Right, right.\5.0\\\\P\
461.0\716.0\P\1.0\2.2\I don't know how often one would concern himself with that as a male, \5.0\\\\P\
461.0\717.0\P\1.0\2.2\how hard that works, \5.0\\\\P\
461.0\718.0\P\1.0\2.2\how much do we do that.\5.0\\\\P\
462.0\719.0\D\1.0\2.14\So you are 49 \5.0\\\\P\
462.0\720.0\D\1.0\2.1\and you are sort of right on the cusp there of where we start thinking about doing these kinds of tests.\5.0\\\\I\
463.0\721.0\P\1.0\3.1\yes m'am\5.0\\\\I\
464.0\722.0\D\1.0\2.2\Um, I'm not aware that you can have increased risk of it if you have had trauma before. \5.0\\\\P\
464.0\723.0\D\1.0\2.1\That I have never heard of.\5.0\\\\I\
465.0\724.0\P\1.0\3.1\Right.  Mhm.\5.0\\\\I\
466.0\725.0\D\83.0\83.0\Um, but I think it's important that we do stand up a bit\5.0\\\\P\
467.0\726.0\P\3.0\3.1\right\5.0\\\\P\
468.0\727.0\D\3.0\3.7\so just so you know, \5.0\\\\P\
468.0\728.0\D\3.0\1.12\do you want to do that today or?\5.0\\\\R\
469.0\729.0\P\3.0\2.13\No\5.0\\\\R\
470.0\730.0\D\3.0\2.121\Okay, so we'll do it next time. \5.0\\\\R\
470.0\731.0\D\3.0\2.121\ We have you come back in a month anyway \5.0\\\\R\
470.0\732.0\D\3.0\2.1\because we are still working, \5.0\\\\R\
470.0\733.0\D\3.0\2.4\that's fine.\5.0\\\\R\
471.0\734.0\P\3.0\2.4\I need time to prepare myself for it.\5.0\\\\R\
472.0\735.0\D\3.0\2.4\That's fine, \5.0\\\\R\
472.0\736.0\D\3.0\3.7\so just so you know, \5.0\\\\R\
472.0\737.0\D\3.0\3.2\it will basically, \5.0\\\\I\
472.0\738.0\D\3.0\2.121\I will use my finger.  \5.0\\\\I\
472.0\739.0\D\3.0\2.121\I'll have a glove on, \5.0\\\\I\
472.0\740.0\D\3.0\2.121\I'll use lubrication.\5.0\\\\I\
473.0\741.0\P\3.0\2.2\Yeah, I know.\5.0\\\\I\
474.0\742.0\D\3.0\2.121\And it shouldn't take more than about 3 seconds.\5.0\\\\I\
475.0\743.0\P\4.1\2.4\The reason I feel comfortable is that I feel you know me.\5.0\\\\R\
476.0\744.0\D\4.1\3.1\Okay.\5.0\\\\R\
477.0\745.0\P\4.2\2.1\And my sexual self is heterosexual, \5.0\\\\P\
477.0\746.0\P\4.1\2.4\I feel very comfortable with that\5.0\\\\R\
478.0\747.0\D\4.1\3.1\ok\5.0\\\\R\
479.0\748.0\P\11.0\11.0\with you.\5.0\\\\R\
480.0\749.0\D\4.1\3.6\Okay. \5.0\\\\R\
480.0\750.0\D\3.0\2.121\ We will do the blood test then we want to do today \5.0\\\\R\
480.0\751.0\D\3.0\82.1\and then\5.0\\\\R\
481.0\752.0\P\3.0\82.0\No, I want to do\5.0\\\\R\
482.0\753.0\D\3.0\2.132\You want to do all of it\5.0\\\\R\
483.0\754.0\P\3.0\2.5\Next time \5.0\\\\P\
483.0\755.0\P\3.0\2.1\because I got an eye appointment today.\5.0\\\\P\
484.0\756.0\D\3.0\3.1\Yeah.\5.0\\\\P\
485.0\757.0\P\3.0\2.1\And it's getting real close \5.0\\\\P\
485.0\758.0\P\3.0\2.5\and I don't want to miss that.\5.0\\\\P\
486.0\759.0\D\3.0\2.4\Okay, fair enough. \5.0\\\\P\
486.0\760.0\D\3.0\2.121\ So then the big thing we need, \5.0\\\\R\
486.0\761.0\D\3.0\2.1\I put that on my list for things to do next time.\5.0\\\\R\
487.0\762.0\P\3.0\3.1\Yes, ma'am.\5.0\\\\R\
488.0\763.0\D\3.0\2.121\And what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a handout on the blood test \5.0\\\\R\
488.0\764.0\D\3.0\3.7\so you know about it, okay.\5.0\\\\R\
489.0\765.0\P\3.0\3.1\all right\5.0\\\\R\4.4
490.0\766.0\D\5.1\3.3\But what I want to do is talk to you about how you are responding to your HIV medicine.\6.0\HIV meds\4.22\D\P\
491.0\767.0\P\5.1\2.4\Great.\6.0\\\\P\
492.0\768.0\D\83.0\83.0\Isn't that what you want to hear?\6.0\\\\P\
493.0\769.0\P\83.0\83.0\All the time.\6.0\\\\P\
494.0\770.0\D\5.14\1.121\All right, so we started the medicines in December, right?\6.0\\\\P\
495.0\771.0\P\5.14\2.13\Umhum.\6.0\\\\P\
496.0\772.0\D\1.13\1.121\And what we want to know is what your viral load is doing, right? \6.0\\\\P\
496.0\773.0\D\1.13\2.12\ And our goal is to get your viral load undetectable.\6.0\\\\P\
497.0\774.0\P\1.13\3.1\Great.\6.0\\\\P\
498.0\775.0\D\1.13\3.2\Okay, so when we first started the medicine, \6.0\\\\P\
498.0\776.0\D\1.13\2.1\your, unfortunately your labs don't appear in the computer.\6.0\\\\P\
499.0\777.0\P\3.0\82.1\Because I'm a different type of\6.0\\\\P\
500.0\778.0\D\3.0\2.14\Right, your labs go out to the University of [Name],\6.0\\\\P\
500.0\779.0\D\1.13\2.1\ but we started, when we first started the medicine your viral load was very, very high.\6.0\\\\P\
501.0\780.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm mhm\6.0\\\\P\
502.0\781.0\D\1.13\3.6\Okay? \6.0\\\\P\
502.0\782.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Now, as of February 12th, it's 325.\6.0\\\\P\
503.0\783.0\P\1.13\1.12\Which is from what?\6.0\\\\P\
504.0\784.0\D\1.13\2.1\From like 75, \6.0\\\\P\
504.0\785.0\D\1.13\3.2\wait, \6.0\\\\P\

505.0\787.0\P\2.8\2.3\Praise the Lord, \6.0\\\\P\
505.0\788.0\P\5.1\2.2\so as long as we keep doing what you tell us to do with this, \6.0\\\\P\
505.0\789.0\P\1.13\2.2\just keep doing what we do to keep getting that increase.\6.0\\\\P\
506.0\790.0\D\1.13\2.1\So, basically this number we want to go as low as possible. \6.0\\\\I\
506.0\791.0\D\1.13\3.2\ OK? \6.0\\\\I\
506.0\792.0\D\1.13\2.1\ You are at 325. \6.0\\\\P\
506.0\793.0\D\1.13\2.1\ I want it to be less than 50.  \6.0\\\\P\
506.0\794.0\D\1.13\1.32\Okay?\6.0\\\\P\
507.0\795.0\P\1.13\1.122\So when we started out it was what?\6.0\\\\P\
508.0\796.0\D\1.13\2.1\700 and, \6.0\\\\P\
508.0\797.0\D\1.13\2.1\125,000, right, \6.0\\\\P\
508.0\798.0\D\1.13\6.2\so let me write that down for you. \6.0\\\\P\

508.0\800.0\D\1.13\2.1\right, like that \6.0\\\\P\
508.0\801.0\D\1.13\2.1\and now it's 325.\6.0\\\\P\
509.0\802.0\P\1.13\1.12\Is that good?\6.0\\\\P\
510.0\803.0\D\1.13\2.4\That's great.  \6.0\\\\P\
510.0\804.0\D\1.13\2.1\This number is going down. \6.0\\\\P\
510.0\805.0\D\1.13\1.32\ See how much it's going down?\6.0\\\\P\
511.0\806.0\P\1.13\2.64\Oh my gosh.\6.0\\\\P\
512.0\807.0\D\1.13\2.1\This is where I want it next, \6.0\\\\P\

521.0\826.0\P\2.4\2.1\and it's a possibility of a person possibly forgetting.\6.0\\\\P\
522.0\827.0\D\2.4\3.1\Right.\6.0\\\\P\
523.0\828.0\P\2.4\2.11\And right now it's been, \6.0\\\\P\

533.0\846.0\P\5.1\2.2\Yeah, I know, but\6.0\\\\P\
534.0\847.0\D\5.1\2.1\that's the bottom line\6.0\\\\P\
535.0\848.0\P\5.1\2.2\I think it's important, yeah, \6.0\\\\P\
535.0\849.0\P\5.1\2.2\but I'm saying it's important to your prescribed information and suggestion.\6.0\\\\P\
536.0\850.0\D\5.1\3.6\Right, \6.0\\\\P\
536.0\851.0\D\5.1\2.42\well and you are doing a great job \6.0\\\\E\

548.0\871.0\D\2.6\1.12\if they don't know, was someone in social work seeing you? \8.0\\\\P\

567.0\909.0\P\1.16\83.0\but once this more lifestyle, \10.0\\\\P\
567.0\910.0\P\1.16\2.5\I'm going to start including a lot of fruits in my diet \10.0\\\\P\
567.0\911.0\P\1.16\2.5\and I'm going to be eating, um meat for periods of time \10.0\\\\P\
567.0\912.0\P\1.16\2.5\and it's just going to be fruit.\10.0\\\\P\
568.0\913.0\D\1.16\3.1\Okay.\10.0\\\\P\
