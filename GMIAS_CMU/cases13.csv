9.0\12.0\D\1.0\1.11\ So how are you doing since I last saw you?\10.0\1.0\out of meds\3.2\P\P\
10.0\13.0\P\1.0\2.4\I'm doing pretty good. \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
10.0\14.0\P\5.116\2.1\ I'm out of my medications, though, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
10.0\15.0\P\5.11\2.11\I haven't had them in about four or five days.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
11.0\16.0\D\5.11\1.11\why what happened?\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
12.0\17.0\P\5.116\2.1\I ran out.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
13.0\18.0\D\5.116\2.2\I know, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
13.0\19.0\D\5.116\1.11\but why didn't you call us?\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
14.0\20.0\P\5.116\2.2\I didn't know how to do that.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
14.0\21.0\P\5.116\2.1\I just thought I normally get it by appointments.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\22.0\D\5.116\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\23.0\D\5.116\1.122\Four or five days, you said?\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
16.0\24.0\P\5.116\2.11\Yes.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
17.0\25.0\D\5.116\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
17.0\26.0\D\5.11\2.1\And the reason I say that is because from one of the HIV medicines you're on, the Sustiva?\18.0\1.0\\\\P\
18.0\27.0\P\5.11\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
19.0\28.0\D\5.11\2.1\You know it becomes dangerous, in terms of resistance, for people to stop or run out.\16.0\1.0\\\\I\
20.0\29.0\P\5.11\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\30.0\D\6.0\2.1\So for instance, with blood pressure meds, if you run out, I know it can be dangerous \17.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\31.0\D\6.0\2.1\because your blood pressure goes sky high, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\32.0\D\6.0\2.4\but, so that's not a good example \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\33.0\D\6.0\2.63\[chuckles] \1.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\34.0\D\6.0\2.1\ But, you know for instance, if there's something else that you're taking right now, like an allergy med or something, it's not so important if you run out, \28.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\35.0\D\5.11\2.1\but with the HIV, the way the virus is, it mutates very easily. \13.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\36.0\D\5.11\2.14\So I one of things we talked about is not missing doses, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\37.0\D\5.12\2.2\which I know that has not been an issue for you in the past.  \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
21.0\38.0\D\5.11\2.1\But the other problem is when people run out with the Sustiva, what happens is \15.0\1.0\\\\P\
21.0\39.0\D\5.11\2.1\because it hangs around in your body so long, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\40.0\D\5.11\82.0\you end up um, \4.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\41.0\D\5.1\2.1\and then the other one, the Epzicom, kind of runs out shorter.\12.0\1.0\\\\I\
22.0\42.0\P\5.11\3.1\hmm\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
23.0\43.0\D\5.11\2.1\The Sustiva can stay in your body for like two to four weeks after you stop taking it, \18.0\1.0\\\\I\
23.0\44.0\D\5.11\2.4\which you might think is a good thing, \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
23.0\45.0\D\5.11\2.1\except the problem is the Epzicom doesn't, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
23.0\46.0\D\5.11\2.1\so you end up being on what your body thinks is only one HIV med.\15.0\1.0\\\\I\
24.0\47.0\P\5.11\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
25.0\48.0\D\5.11\2.1\And when you're only on one med, the virus tends to mutate.  \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
25.0\49.0\D\5.11\2.1\So that's why it's such a concern when you, you know stop taking the meds, \15.0\1.0\\\\I\
25.0\50.0\D\5.11\2.1\specifically the Sustiva\3.0\1.0\\\\I\
26.0\51.0\P\5.11\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
27.0\52.0\D\5.11\11.0\um specifically when people are on Sustiva, as one of the meds. \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
27.0\53.0\D\5.11\5.3\ So I just wanted to make sure you know that, \10.0\1.0\\\\I\
27.0\54.0\D\5.116\5.4\so that if it happens again where you're starting to run out, please call us, \15.0\1.0\\\\R\1.3
27.0\55.0\D\5.116\2.1\you know, there's not a problem in terms of getting refills and things like that.\15.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\56.0\P\5.116\2.2\Yeah, I didn't know it, \5.0\1.0\\\\I\
28.0\57.0\P\5.116\2.2\but I know it now.\5.0\1.0\\\\I\
29.0\58.0\D\5.116\3.6\Right, \1.0\1.0\\\\I\
29.0\59.0\D\5.11\2.5\so that's why I wanted to let you know. \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
29.0\60.0\D\5.11\2.12\ Now four, five days, you know, I don't expect that, you know, \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
29.0\61.0\D\1.13\2.1\since you were undetectable\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\62.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\63.0\D\5.11\82.0\I don't expect, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\64.0\D\5.1\2.121\we're just going to restart.  \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\65.0\D\5.11\2.1\I mean there's only the risk, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\66.0\D\5.11\2.1\but generally the longer you were off it, the more risk there is that you develop a resistance. \18.0\1.0\\\\I\
31.0\67.0\D\5.11\2.12\ So I don't think in four or five days, \9.0\1.0\\\\I\
31.0\68.0\D\5.11\2.14\since this is the first time this has happened, you know.  \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\69.0\D\5.11\2.1\So the more times it happens, the more at risk you are, \12.0\1.0\\\\I\
31.0\70.0\D\5.11\2.1\and then the longer you are off it, the more at risk you are.  \14.0\1.0\\\\I\
31.0\71.0\D\5.11\2.12\So I think four or five days, you know \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\72.0\D\5.11\5.1\if that's how long it really was\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\73.0\P\5.11\3.6\I understand.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\74.0\D\5.1\11.0\Then we should be able to just restart, \8.0\1.0\\\\R\
33.0\75.0\D\5.1\2.121\and then we'll just see. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\76.0\D\5.11\2.12\ But my guess is that you probably didn't develop a whole lot of resistance, \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\77.0\D\5.11\2.1\because it's been such a short time.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\78.0\D\5.116\5.1\But I'd just be very careful about it in the future, \11.0\1.0\\\\R\
33.0\79.0\D\5.116\5.4\just give us a call, \5.0\1.0\\\\R\
33.0\80.0\D\5.11\5.5\because the more times that happens, the more chance you have of becoming resistant.\14.0\1.0\\\\R\1.3
34.0\81.0\P\5.116\2.51\I thought about calling you, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\82.0\P\5.116\2.12\but I say,  Well, the doctor's need to see you\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\83.0\D\5.116\3.6\Right.  Right. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\84.0\D\5.116\5.7\ Well don't feel shy about calling.  \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
35.0\85.0\D\5.116\5.7\That's why we're here.  \4.0\1.0\\\\E\
35.0\86.0\D\5.116\5.7\Um I'd much rather have you call than not call.\10.0\1.0\\\\R\
36.0\87.0\P\5.116\2.51\I thought about calling late\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\88.0\D\5.116\3.1\right\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
38.0\89.0\P\5.116\2.51\but again, I said, I'll just speak to her in person.\11.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\90.0\D\5.116\3.6\Right.  Right. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\91.0\D\5.11\5.5\ So I just wanted to let you know that that's, with the Epzicom and Sustiva specifically, you know, that's a big concern of ours.  So.  \25.0\1.0\\\\I\
39.0\92.0\D\5.1\5.1\But I think we are just going to restart, \9.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
39.0\93.0\D\5.1\5.1\and then just see how you do, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\94.0\D\1.13\5.1\and then we'll check your CD4s \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\95.0\D\1.13\5.1\and viral loads.  \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\96.0\D\5.1\2.121\If you're still undetectable, then you're not gonna get  resistance.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\97.0\P\5.1\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\98.0\D\1.13\2.51\I had been planning to check that, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\99.0\D\1.13\5.1\but we should probably check that um today\8.0\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\100.0\P\3.0\2.1\I give you some blood a couple weeks ago.\9.0\2.0\blood tests\2.2\P\P\
43.0\101.0\D\3.0\1.122\Oh you did?  \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\102.0\D\3.0\2.13\Oh yeah, couple weeks ago. \5.0\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\103.0\D\1.13\2.4\ So that looks good.  \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\104.0\D\1.13\2.1\From November 16th, \3.0\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\105.0\D\5.12\2.1\that was why you were still taking the meds, \9.0\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\106.0\D\1.13\2.1\you were undetectable \3.0\2.0\\\\R\
43.0\107.0\D\1.13\2.1\and your CD4 was 296.  \5.0\2.0\\\\R\
43.0\108.0\D\1.13\2.4\ Everything looked good.\3.0\2.0\\\\R\
44.0\109.0\P\1.13\1.122\Is that good ?\4.0\2.0\\\\R\
45.0\110.0\D\1.13\2.4\Yeah, that's excellent.  \3.0\2.0\\\\R\1.12
45.0\111.0\D\1.13\2.1\But the main thing, the reason I want to check it again today is just because you were off it for four or five days, \25.0\1.0\\\\P\
45.0\112.0\D\1.13\2.121\so I can see if you're still undetectable or not.\10.0\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\113.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\114.0\D\1.13\2.4\Cuz if you're undetectable, then we don't have to worry at all about [5w].  \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\115.0\D\1.13\2.121\And if you aren't undetectable, then we may want that one in another month\14.0\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\116.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\117.0\D\1.13\11.0\the viral load, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\118.0\D\1.13\2.121\just to make sure you are.\6.0\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\119.0\P\1.13\6.21\No problem.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\120.0\D\1.13\5.1\But if you are,  then we'll just do the three months, you know, so. \14.0\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\121.0\D\1.13\2.5\ But I just wanted to let you know, so\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\122.0\P\5.116\2.2\The reason that [5w] I can call up here.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\123.0\D\5.116\5.6\Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\124.0\D\5.116\5.4\And do it a couple days in advance, \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\125.0\D\5.116\2.121\that way we won't have any problems. \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\126.0\D\1.13\2.1\ But yeah, your CD4's gone you know from February, of 33, up to 296, \14.0\2.0\\\\R\
53.0\127.0\D\1.13\2.1\which is excellent. \3.0\2.0\\\\R\
53.0\128.0\D\5.1\2.1\ You're responding really well with these meds. \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
53.0\129.0\D\5.1\2.12\ I think they'll continue to work well for you. \9.0\2.0\\\\P\
53.0\130.0\D\5.2\1.11\ How's the itching doing? \4.0\3.0\itching\3.1\D\P\
53.0\131.0\D\5.2\1.12\ Gone or you still have?\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
54.0\132.0\P\5.2\2.1\Every damn day like maybe uh once a week, or maybe twice a week.  You know, about once a week.\20.0\3.0\\\\P\
55.0\133.0\D\5.2\3.6\Mhm.  \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
55.0\134.0\D\5.2\1.122\You still have some itching?\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
56.0\135.0\P\5.2\2.1\Only when I go to bed.\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
57.0\136.0\D\5.2\1.121\And then it'll go away?\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
58.0\137.0\P\5.2\2.13\Yeah.  It goes away\4.0\3.0\\\\P\
59.0\138.0\D\5.2\3.1\hm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
60.0\139.0\P\5.2\2.1\It'll go away before I go to sleep.  \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
60.0\140.0\P\5.2\2.4\But it really is a mild itch, \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
60.0\141.0\P\5.2\2.1\like maybe my neck might itch\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
61.0\142.0\D\5.2\3.1\ok\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
62.0\143.0\P\5.2\11.0\back to around my shoulder.\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
63.0\144.0\D\5.2\1.121\Not like it was in the beginning? \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
63.0\145.0\D\5.2\2.63\[chuckles]\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
64.0\146.0\P\5.2\2.13\No, no, no.\3.0\3.0\\\\P\5.0
65.0\147.0\D\5.11\1.12\And what about, when you were taking the meds and before you ran out, were you missing any doses?\19.0\4.0\adherence\3.1\D\P\
66.0\148.0\P\5.12\2.11\no\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
67.0\149.0\D\5.11\1.12\like once  a week or once a?\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
68.0\150.0\P\5.12\2.11\No, I never miss a week.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
69.0\151.0\D\5.12\5.7\Good.  \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
69.0\152.0\D\5.12\2.2\I know you haven't in the past \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
69.0\153.0\D\5.12\2.1\but I'm always doublechecking.\4.0\4.0\\\\P\
70.0\154.0\P\5.12\2.42\Thank you.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\5.0
71.0\155.0\D\3.0\1.12\Did you ever see Dr. [name of doctor]?\8.0\6.0\blood prs\3.1\D\P\
72.0\156.0\P\3.0\2.11\Yes, I seen her.\4.0\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\157.0\D\3.0\1.122\You saw her?  \3.0\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\158.0\D\3.0\1.12\And when do you see here again?\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
74.0\159.0\P\3.0\3.2\Um, \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
74.0\160.0\P\3.0\2.5\I have to call for an appointment.\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
75.0\161.0\D\3.0\1.122\You have to call\4.0\6.0\\\\P\
76.0\162.0\P\3.0\2.1\I don't have no appointment, \5.0\6.0\\\\P\
76.0\163.0\P\3.0\2.5\but I got to call for appointment.\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
77.0\164.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay. \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
77.0\165.0\D\1.14\1.12\ And did she say anything about your blood pressure, \9.0\6.0\\\\P\
77.0\166.0\D\1.14\1.12\or calling you about your blood pressure?\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
78.0\167.0\P\6.0\1.121\Well wasn't it you who wrote me the 200 Toprol or something?\12.0\6.0\\\\P\
79.0\168.0\D\6.0\2.13\Right.  Right.\2.0\6.0\\\\P\
80.0\169.0\P\6.0\2.11\Cuz I just started taking that one.  \7.0\6.0\\\\P\
80.0\170.0\P\6.0\2.12\I guess I probably need it before today though \9.0\6.0\\\\P\

81.0\173.0\D\6.0\1.121\Oh, the Lisinopril?\3.0\6.0\\\\P\
82.0\174.0\P\6.0\2.13\Mhm.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\

107.0\210.0\D\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
108.0\211.0\P\6.0\2.1\Cuz that's what Ms. [name] wrote me, \7.0\6.0\\\\P\

111.0\215.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay. \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
111.0\216.0\D\3.0\82.0\ Cuz um generally, \3.0\6.0\\\\P\
111.0\217.0\D\3.0\2.1\kind of the reason I'm asking all this, \8.0\6.0\\\\P\
111.0\218.0\D\3.0\2.1\generally once you have a primary doctor\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
112.0\219.0\P\3.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
113.0\220.0\D\3.0\11.0\you know, like Dr. [name of doctor], they usually take over all the blood pressure management. \16.0\6.0\\\\P\
113.0\221.0\D\3.0\2.5\ Usually we like, generally we try to have only one doctor\11.0\6.0\\\\P\
114.0\222.0\P\3.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
115.0\223.0\D\3.0\11.0\changing the blood pressure meds, right?  \6.0\6.0\\\\P\
115.0\224.0\D\3.0\2.1\Just like she wouldn't change your HIV meds without, I mean, without consulting with me.\15.0\6.0\\\\P\
116.0\225.0\P\3.0\1.122\Who [2w] me the 200s?\5.0\6.0\\\\P\

117.0\227.0\D\3.0\2.1\because you hadn't seen her yet.  Yeah, you hadn't seen her yet, \12.0\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\228.0\D\6.0\83.0\and it's hard to take the 200, \7.0\6.0\\\\P\
117.0\229.0\D\1.14\2.1\because your blood pressure's high.\5.0\6.0\\\\P\
118.0\230.0\P\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
119.0\231.0\D\6.0\3.6\So it's fine.  \3.0\6.0\\\\P\
119.0\232.0\D\6.0\5.4\Continue to do that, \4.0\6.0\\\\P\
119.0\233.0\D\6.0\5.4\we'll continue with the [Facinoprava], \5.0\6.0\\\\P\

127.0\242.0\D\3.0\3.6\Yeah, \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
127.0\243.0\D\3.0\5.1\cuz what I would start doing is um, ask her, when you see her, if she wants to be managing your blood pressure, \23.0\6.0\\\\P\
127.0\244.0\D\3.0\5.1\or if she wants us to be.\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
128.0\245.0\P\3.0\6.21\ok\1.0\6.0\\\\P\

129.0\247.0\D\3.0\2.12\but I'd probably need to see you a little more frequently than every three months, \15.0\6.0\\\\P\

139.0\265.0\D\1.14\2.5\I just wanted to make sure that, if it was high, that somebody's kind of following.  \16.0\6.0\\\\P\

143.0\270.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay. \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
143.0\271.0\D\3.0\5.4\ So just ask her, \4.0\6.0\\\\P\

143.0\273.0\D\3.0\5.4\and then she should just let us know.\8.0\6.0\\\\R\

177.0\359.0\D\1.17\2.2\ I didn't know [3w] why I don't have that written down. \11.0\8.0\\\\P\

177.0\361.0\D\82.0\82.0\and then we will probably \5.0\8.0\\\\P\5.0
177.0\362.0\D\1.17\5.1\um, well now that your CD4's above 200, it would be worthwhile to do the pneumonia \16.0\9.0\vacc\2.1\D\R\
177.0\363.0\D\1.17\5.1\and tetanus vaccinations.\3.0\9.0\\\\R\
178.0\364.0\P\1.13\1.12\What is my CD4 supposed to be?\7.0\10.0\CD4\4.1\P\P\
179.0\365.0\D\1.13\2.1\Well, so if you're, if you don't have HIV, the CD4 usually ranges between 800 and 1200.\17.0\10.0\\\\R\
180.0\366.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\10.0\\\\R\1.3
181.0\367.0\D\1.13\2.14\Once you've gone pretty low, \5.0\10.0\\\\P\
181.0\368.0\D\1.13\2.14\and your CD4 was pretty low when we first started treatment, \11.0\10.0\\\\P\
181.0\369.0\D\1.13\2.12\it may not come all the way back up to normal\11.0\10.0\\\\P\
182.0\370.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\10.0\\\\P\
183.0\371.0\D\1.13\2.12\because the higher you are when you start treatment, the more likely you are to go higher.  \17.0\10.0\\\\I\
183.0\372.0\D\1.14\2.1\Now you've responded really well to treatment\7.0\10.0\\\\P\
184.0\373.0\P\1.14\3.1\mhm\1.0\10.0\\\\P\
185.0\374.0\D\1.13\2.12\so it may, it may over time go up into the normal, you know, [3w] normal range.  \17.0\10.0\\\\P\
185.0\375.0\D\1.13\2.2\However, we do know the higher it is, the less chance of infection, \13.0\10.0\\\\I\
185.0\376.0\D\1.13\2.2\the less problems. \3.0\10.0\\\\I\
185.0\377.0\D\1.13\2.5\ So for instance, once you're above 200, we want to knock out a lot of the infections.  \17.0\10.0\\\\I\
185.0\378.0\D\6.0\1.121\And I know we talked about, you know, you're taking the Bactrim \12.0\10.0\\\\P\
185.0\379.0\D\6.0\1.121\and the Azithromycin\3.0\10.0\\\\P\

188.0\382.0\P\6.0\1.121\That's the two pills\4.0\10.0\\\\P\

190.0\384.0\P\6.0\3.6\right\1.0\10.0\\\\P\
191.0\385.0\D\6.0\2.121\And those, you know, once your CD4's above 200 for three months\12.0\10.0\\\\I\
192.0\386.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\10.0\\\\I\
193.0\387.0\D\11.0\11.0\Then we stop that. \4.0\10.0\\\\I\
193.0\388.0\D\1.13\82.0\ So if your CD4 um today, \6.0\10.0\\\\P\
193.0\389.0\D\3.0\2.121\if we can get the blood work today, we may have to have you come back, \16.0\10.0\\\\P\
193.0\390.0\D\3.0\2.2\because I know they close at 500.\7.0\10.0\\\\P\

197.0\400.0\D\1.13\3.0\oh, what was I going to say? \7.0\10.0\\\\P\
197.0\401.0\D\1.13\5.1\ If we do it, once you're above, you know, today if it's above 200 \14.0\10.0\\\\P\
197.0\402.0\D\6.0\5.1\and next month it's above 200, then you can stop all of the antibiotics like the Bactrim and the Azithromycin.\20.0\10.0\\\\P\
198.0\403.0\P\6.0\1.12\Is that what you prescribed?\5.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\404.0\D\6.0\2.13\Right.  Right.  Yeah.  \3.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\405.0\D\6.0\2.1\That's the one pill, \4.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\406.0\D\6.0\2.1\once a day, \3.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\407.0\D\6.0\2.1\and the two pills \4.0\10.0\\\\P\

199.0\409.0\D\6.0\2.1\ And that's preventing infection.  \4.0\10.0\\\\I\
199.0\410.0\D\1.13\2.65\So it's great that you're above 200, \7.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\411.0\D\6.0\5.1\and if you're above 200 this month and next month, then we can stop you know the Bactrim \18.0\10.0\\\\P\

199.0\413.0\D\5.1\2.121\and then you'd just be on the HIV meds \9.0\10.0\\\\P\
199.0\414.0\D\6.0\2.121\and the blood pressure meds.\5.0\10.0\\\\P\
200.0\415.0\P\6.0\3.1\ok\1.0\10.0\\\\P\
201.0\416.0\D\6.0\2.65\So that's good.\3.0\10.0\\\\P\
202.0\417.0\P\6.0\3.1\ok\1.0\10.0\\\\P\

374.0\715.0\D\6.0\5.1\I would say, if you take it in the morning\10.0\6.0\\\\P\
375.0\716.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
376.0\717.0\D\6.0\2.12\Then you shouldn't wake up at night, for instance, to go to the bathroom.\14.0\6.0\\\\P\
377.0\718.0\P\1.14\2.1\But that's just it, at night I go to the bathroom about maybe between the hours of 1130 and 500 I may go to the bathroom about four times.\29.0\6.0\\\\P\
378.0\719.0\D\1.16\1.12\And when do you stop drinking fluid?\7.0\6.0\\\\P\
379.0\720.0\P\1.16\2.11\Never.\1.0\6.0\\\\P\
380.0\721.0\D\1.16\5.1\- I would stop drinking\5\6.0\\\\R\2.0
381\722\P\1.1600\2.110\If I wake up I'll drink a cup of water.\10\6.0\\\\P\
382\723\D\1.1600\5.100\I would stop drinking stuff by like 500 or 600 PM.  \11\6.0\\\\R\
382\724\D\1.1600\5.100\And then you could have sips\6\6.0\\\\R\
383\725\P\1.1600\3.100\mhm\1\6.0\\\\R\
384\726\D\1.1600\11.000\like small small sips of water, just to wet your mouth, \11\6.0\\\\R\
384\727\D\1.1600\5.100\and see if that changes the way you urinate.\9\6.0\\\\P\
385\728\P\1.1600\2.110\Because usually between the hours of 600 and let's say 1200\11\6.0\\\\P\
386\729\D\1.1600\3.100\uh huh\2\6.0\\\\P\
387\730\P\1.1600\11.000\I'll drink about 50 to 60 ounces of water.\9\6.0\\\\P\
388\731\D\1.1600\3.600\Yeah.  \1\6.0\\\\P\
388\732\D\1.1600\2.400\That's a lot,  \3\6.0\\\\P\

388\734\D\1.1600\11.000\ right?\1\6.0\\\\P\
389\735\P\1.1600\1.120\Is that too much?\4\6.0\\\\P\
390\736\D\1.1600\1.121\Well it's a lot if you're going to try to go to sleep, right?\14\6.0\\\\P\
391\737\P\1.1400\2.100\But I don't have no problems going to sleep.\9\6.0\\\\P\
392\738\D\1.1400\2.100\Well, I don't mean that, I mean literally to get up to go to the bathroom.  \16\6.0\\\\P\
392\739\D\1.1400\2.630\[giggles]\1\6.0\\\\99.0\

393\741\P\1.1400\2.100\I mean I'll wake up to go to the bathroom.\10\6.0\\\\P\
394\742\D\1.1400\3.100\Yeah.\1\6.0\\\\P\
395\743\P\1.1400\2.100\But as soon as I go to the bathroom, \9\6.0\\\\P\
395\744\P\1.1400\2.100\as soon as I lay back down I'm asleep.\9\6.0\\\\P\
396\745\D\1.1400\3.600\Right, right.  \2\6.0\\\\P\
396\746\D\1.1400\2.100\Well I didn't mean if you have trouble sleeping, \9\6.0\\\\P\
396\747\D\1.1400\2.100\just so you don't have to get up to go to the bathroom. \13\6.0\\\\P\
396\748\D\1.1400\2.400\ But I mean if it doesn't bother you to get up to go to the bathroom, then there's nothing wrong with it.\22\6.0\\\\P\
397\749\P\1.1400\2.720\No it don't bother me.\5\6.0\\\\P\
398\750\D\6.0000\2.400\But I just wanted to let you know, like I think the hydrochlorothiazide is one of the better blood pressure meds\21\6.0\\\\I\
399\751\P\6.0000\3.100\Hm\1\6.0\\\\I\
400\752\D\6.0000\5.100\that's why I'd recommend that you go on it. \9\6.0\\\\R\
400\753\D\6.0000\2.121\ But I would warn you that during the first week, you'll notice that you urinate more. \16\6.0\\\\P\
400\754\D\6.0000\2.121\ Now once you're taking it every day\7\6.0\\\\P\
401\755\P\6.0000\3.100\mhm\1\6.0\\\\P\
402\756\D\6.0000\11.000\that should start to go away, \6\6.0\\\\P\
402\757\D\6.0000\2.100\because your body kind of readjusts to its own level of\11\6.0\\\\P\
403\758\P\1.1400\2.400\Well can't be no more than what I go now, \10\6.0\\\\P\

404\760\D\1.1400\2.630\[laughs]\1\6.0\\\\\
405\761\P\81.0000\81.000\But then again, I [5w].\5\6.0\\\\P\
406\762\D\6.0000\1.220\Are you willing to try it?\6\6.0\\\\R\
407\763\P\6.0000\6.210\I'm, certainly.\2\6.0\\\\R\
408\764\D\6.0000\3.100\Okay.\1\6.0\\\\R\2.1
409\765\P\1.1600\2.110\But I drink a lot of water now.\8\6.0\\\\P\
410\766\D\1.1600\3.600\Okay. \1\6.0\\\\P\
410\767\D\6.0000\2.121\ Well this won't make you drink more\7\6.0\\\\I\
411\768\P\6.0000\3.600\Okay, \1\6.0\\\\P\
411\769\P\1.1600\1.120\is there a certain amount of water a person's supposed to drink?\12\6.0\\\\P\
412\770\D\1.1600\2.100\Um, yeah.  \2\6.0\\\\P\
412\771\D\1.1600\2.100\I mean, if you drink too much, it would lower your sodium, \12\6.0\\\\I\
412\772\D\1.1500\2.100\and we haven't seen that yet.\6\6.0\\\\P\
413\773\P\1.1500\3.600\Okay, \1\6.0\\\\P\
413\774\P\1.1600\2.110\well I drink a lot of water.\7\6.0\\\\P\
414\775\D\1.1600\5.600\So as long as it's not doing that, then it's okay.\11\6.0\\\\P\
415\776\P\1.1600\3.600\Okay.\1\6.0\\\\P\
416\777\D\6.0000\5.300\So I want you to take one a day of this.\11\6.0\\\\R\
