96.0\161.0\D\8.0\3.6\Uh huh. \2.0\2.0\\\\P\
96.0\162.0\D\8.0\1.12\ Do you have to get a prescription to get new ones, or\12.0\2.0\\\\P\

98.0\165.0\D\8.0\5.3\ Cuz if they're breaking down right now, we need to get some new ones. \14.0\2.0\\\\P\
98.0\166.0\D\8.0\2.1\ Cuz they really have helped.\5.0\2.0\\\\P\

100.0\171.0\D\8.0\2.12\But you'll probably want a new one eventually.\8.0\2.0\\\\P\
101.0\172.0\P\1.14\81.0\[2w] my legs.\3.0\2.0\\\\P\
102.0\173.0\D\1.14\2.65\Oh God, that looks really good!  \6.0\2.0\\\\P\

104.0\177.0\D\1.14\82.1\It's not as you know\5.0\2.0\\\\P\
105.0\178.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's not as hard\4.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\179.0\D\1.14\2.43\It's not as hard.  It's not as hard.  \8.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\180.0\D\1.14\2.1\The skin is softer, \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\181.0\D\1.14\2.1\and definitely less swelling. \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\182.0\D\1.14\2.4\ But really the impressive thing is it's not as hard. \10.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\183.0\D\6.0\5.6\ But I do think as long as it keeps getting better, I think it's fine to, you know, get the chemo every three months, \24.0\2.0\\\\P\
106.0\184.0\D\6.0\1.121\cuz you, the kept giving you more time in between?\10.0\2.0\\\\P\

108.0\189.0\D\6.0\3.1\Mhm\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
109.0\190.0\P\6.0\3.2\And, but\2.0\2.0\\\\P\
110.0\191.0\D\6.0\2.2\I'm not sure he wants to go longer than three months, though.  \12.0\2.0\\\\P\
110.0\192.0\D\6.0\2.4\That's pretty long in between each treatment.  \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
110.0\193.0\D\6.0\1.11\What did he say?\4.0\2.0\\\\P\
111.0\194.0\P\6.0\2.11\Uhh, I didn't talk to him about it.\8.0\2.0\\\\P\
112.0\195.0\D\6.0\3.1\oh\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
113.0\196.0\P\6.0\2.12\I was just thinking about it\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
114.0\197.0\D\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
115.0\198.0\P\6.0\2.1\With he said that we were gonna try to do it the way it is right now, \17.0\2.0\\\\P\
115.0\199.0\P\6.0\2.1\and if it's still working we're gonna extend it a little more.\12.0\2.0\\\\P\
116.0\200.0\D\6.0\1.12\How long has it been that you've been doing it every three months?\13.0\2.0\\\\P\
117.0\201.0\P\6.0\2.1\For . . . uh for a year.\8.0\2.0\\\\P\
118.0\202.0\D\6.0\3.6\For a year now?  \4.0\2.0\\\\P\
118.0\203.0\D\6.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
119.0\204.0\P\6.0\2.1\A little less than a year.\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
120.0\205.0\D\6.0\2.12\He's probably wanted to go a year.  \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
120.0\206.0\D\6.0\82.0\I mean, you know you've been\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
121.0\207.0\P\6.0\2.12\I think it's been a year.\6.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\208.0\D\6.0\3.6\Yeah. \1.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\209.0\D\6.0\5.1\ So it's probably worth you could talk to him about that, \11.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\210.0\D\6.0\2.5\but we need to at least have his opinion, \9.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\211.0\D\6.0\2.1\cuz in the end he's in charge of that, you know?  \11.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\212.0\D\6.0\5.3\We do have to respect his opinion, \7.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\213.0\D\6.0\2.1\cuz it's um you're you're not typical of people who get that kind of treatment, \15.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\214.0\D\6.0\2.1\because um usually with the Tcells doing so well people don't need that. \13.0\2.0\\\\I\
122.0\215.0\D\6.0\2.14\ But every time we've tried to stop, you know you've had trouble. \12.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\216.0\D\6.0\5.3\ So we don't want to stop, \6.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\217.0\D\6.0\2.5\but we want to give it as less, at least as possible. \12.0\2.0\\\\P\
122.0\218.0\D\6.0\2.1\ The least amount of treatment that you need is the best\11.0\2.0\\\\P\
123.0\219.0\P\6.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\2.0\\\\P\
124.0\220.0\D\6.0\11.0\when it comes to the chemo. \6.0\2.0\\\\P\5.0
124.0\221.0\D\1.13\2.1\ With the HIV stuff, you're doing well, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
124.0\222.0\D\5.31\3.7\although I can't help but wonder, \6.0\3.0\side effects\2.1\D\P\
124.0\223.0\D\5.31\2.1\I'm looking at your meds, \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
124.0\224.0\D\5.31\2.12\and I'm wondering, \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
124.0\225.0\D\5.2\3.3\cuz you know what I'm noticing? \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
124.0\226.0\D\5.2\2.1\ You're having a little bit of loss of some of the facial fat. \13.0\3.0\\\\P\
124.0\227.0\D\5.2\1.31\ You know what I mean?\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
125.0\228.0\P\5.2\1.122\Loosened  Facial fat?\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
126.0\229.0\D\5.2\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
126.0\230.0\D\5.2\2.1\ This is something that some people get on the medicines\10.0\3.0\\\\I\
127.0\231.0\P\5.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\I\
128.0\232.0\D\5.2\2.12\and one of your medicines in particular is, I think probably starting to do that.  \15.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\233.0\D\5.31\2.14\And you've been on this combination for awhile, \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\234.0\D\5.31\82.0\and I'm wondering whether we can, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\235.0\D\5.31\2.14\cuz you're on four different medicines. . . . \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\236.0\D\5.31\2.11\and I'm just kind of looking back at your combination here. \11.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\237.0\D\5.31\2.12\ I'm trying to think if we can get rid of that one medicine.  \13.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\238.0\D\5.31\2.12\It's the Videx. \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\239.0\D\5.31\2.5\ The Videx is the one that I'd like to, if possible, not keep you on.  \15.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\240.0\D\5.31\2.5\And I need to think of what I can use safely instead. \12.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\241.0\D\5.31\2.12\ And you know, based on what we've used before \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\242.0\D\5.31\2.12\and the tests that we've done, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
128.0\243.0\D\5.31\1.31\you know the resistance tests that we did before?\9.0\3.0\\\\P\
129.0\244.0\P\5.31\2.2\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
130.0\245.0\D\5.31\2.12\. . . . I'm really thinking that we might be able to drop the Videx \16.0\3.0\\\\P\
130.0\246.0\D\5.31\2.12\and just carefully watch the results.\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
131.0\247.0\P\5.31\3.1\alright\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
132.0\248.0\D\5.31\2.12\We may not need it at all.\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
133.0\249.0\P\5.2\1.12\So the Videx is for for what do you say\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
134.0\250.0\D\5.2\1.122\Say that again?\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
135.0\251.0\P\5.2\82.0\For my facial\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
136.0\252.0\D\5.2\82.0\The Videx, \2.0\3.0\\\\I\
136.0\253.0\D\5.2\2.1\people on HIV medicines, sometimes the body changes the way that it stores the fat in the body.\18.0\3.0\\\\I\
137.0\254.0\P\5.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\I\
138.0\255.0\D\5.2\2.1\And we all have some fat that's normal\8.0\3.0\\\\I\
139.0\256.0\P\5.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\I\
140.0\257.0\D\5.2\11.0\under the skin, \3.0\3.0\\\\I\
140.0\258.0\D\5.2\2.1\and it actually helps things look normal.\7.0\3.0\\\\I\
141.0\259.0\P\5.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\I\
142.0\260.0\D\5.2\11.0\Especially around bone. \3.0\3.0\\\\I\
142.0\261.0\D\5.2\2.1\ So in our face it's very noticeable if we start to lose it. \13.0\3.0\\\\I\
142.0\262.0\D\5.2\2.12\ And you may not have noticed, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
142.0\263.0\D\5.2\2.1\because it's very gradual. \4.0\3.0\\\\P\
142.0\264.0\D\5.2\2.1\ But I'm just noticing, really for the first time when I look at you, that you're starting to have a little bit of some thinness\25.0\3.0\\\\P\
143.0\265.0\P\5.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
144.0\266.0\D\5.2\11.0\in the skin\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
145.0\267.0\P\5.2\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
146.0\268.0\D\5.2\11.0\on the face.  \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
146.0\269.0\D\5.2\2.1\But it's a little noticeable.  \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
146.0\270.0\D\5.2\2.121\And my concern is that if we don't change the medicine, that that may get worse over time \18.0\3.0\\\\P\
146.0\271.0\D\5.2\2.121\and become much more noticeable, \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
146.0\272.0\D\5.2\2.5\which, you know, people don't want that to happen if you can prevent it.\14.0\3.0\\\\P\
147.0\273.0\P\5.2\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
148.0\274.0\D\5.2\3.7\So that's what I'm talking about, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
148.0\275.0\D\5.2\2.5\is trying to prevent this from going any further.  \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
148.0\276.0\D\5.2\2.1\And some medicines do it more than others, \8.0\3.0\\\\I\
148.0\277.0\D\5.2\2.12\and of the medicines that you take, the Videx is the one that probably is responsible, more than the others.\20.0\3.0\\\\P\
149.0\278.0\P\5.2\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
150.0\279.0\D\5.31\2.1\Now I look back to when we started that, \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
150.0\280.0\D\5.31\2.1\and it was when we changed your medicine.  \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
150.0\281.0\D\5.31\2.14\Remember you used to take, long ago, you took Viracept\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
151.0\282.0\P\5.31\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
152.0\283.0\D\5.31\11.0\with some other medicines?  \4.0\3.0\\\\P\
152.0\284.0\D\5.31\2.14\And we changed.\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
153.0\285.0\P\5.31\3.6\Yes.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
154.0\286.0\D\5.31\2.14\and when we changed, we looked for resistance.  \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
154.0\287.0\D\5.31\2.14\And you had just a little bit. \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
154.0\288.0\D\5.31\2.51\ And we then, actually, when we changed, we tried to do a resistance test \14.0\3.0\\\\P\
154.0\289.0\D\5.31\2.14\and it didn't show anything\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
155.0\290.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\291.0\D\5.31\2.14\It didn't, they were unable to do the test. \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\292.0\D\5.31\2.2\ So we're not sure at that point what exactly the resistance was.  \12.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\293.0\D\5.31\2.14\So that's why we were cautious, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\294.0\D\5.31\2.14\and we used extra medicine \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\295.0\D\5.31\2.51\to make sure that we fully suppressed, \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\296.0\D\5.31\2.1\and that's what it has done.  \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
156.0\297.0\D\5.31\2.2\But at the same time we don't really know that you need four different medicines instead of three\18.0\3.0\\\\P\
157.0\298.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
158.0\299.0\D\5.31\2.12\And I think it would be very reasonable to take one away, the Videx, \14.0\3.0\\\\P\
158.0\300.0\D\5.31\2.121\and very soon after, check and see if it's staying undetectable.\11.0\3.0\\\\P\
159.0\301.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
160.0\302.0\D\5.31\1.31\Do you see what I'm saying?\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
161.0\303.0\P\5.31\2.2\Yes.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
162.0\304.0\D\5.31\5.1\And that would then make things, if it stays down, then we can stay off the Videx.\17.0\3.0\\\\P\
163.0\305.0\P\5.31\6.21\Okay. \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
163.0\306.0\P\5.31\1.121\ So you want me to take this, it says two bottles, \11.0\3.0\\\\P\
163.0\307.0\P\5.31\1.121\or I mean one pill for each one every day.\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
164.0\308.0\D\5.31\5.3\I want you to take the Sustiva\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
165.0\309.0\P\5.31\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\3.0\\\\P\
166.0\310.0\D\5.31\5.3\And I want you to take the Truvada\8.0\3.0\\\\P\
167.0\311.0\P\5.31\3.6\Truvada.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
168.0\312.0\D\5.31\5.3\But I'm gonna have you stop the Videx.\8.0\3.0\\\\R\
169.0\313.0\P\5.31\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\R\
170.0\314.0\D\5.31\5.3\And then, after a short while, we're gonna have you come back to do another blood test \17.0\3.0\\\\P\
170.0\315.0\D\5.31\2.5\and make sure that the viral level is still low.\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
171.0\316.0\P\5.31\2.5\Stays the same.  \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
171.0\317.0\P\5.31\6.21\Okay.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
172.0\318.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay?  \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
172.0\319.0\D\5.31\2.121\If it is, then I'm gonna say,   Okay, this looks good,  \11.0\3.0\\\\P\
172.0\320.0\D\5.31\2.121\ and I'm still gonna be a little cautious, \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
172.0\321.0\D\5.31\2.121\and I'm gonna check again, maybe in a month and a half later, instead of three months later.  \18.0\3.0\\\\P\
172.0\322.0\D\5.31\2.121\And see if it's still down\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
173.0\323.0\P\5.31\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
174.0\324.0\D\5.31\2.121\and if is, then we'll stay off it.  \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
174.0\325.0\D\5.31\3.2\Okay?\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
175.0\326.0\P\5.2\2.12\Yeah I think I kind of realized too that my face is getting kind of\15.0\3.0\\\\P\
176.0\327.0\D\5.2\3.6\Yeah, yeah. \2.0\3.0\\\\P\
176.0\328.0\D\5.31\5.3\ So let's do this, what I'm gonna do if I'm gonna have you stop the Videx, \16.0\3.0\\\\P\
176.0\329.0\D\5.31\5.3\I'm gonna have you stay on the Truvada and the Sustiva, okay? \12.0\3.0\\\\R\
176.0\330.0\D\5.31\2.121\ And then I'm gonna say about two or three weeks after, we're gonna do a blood test again\18.0\3.0\\\\P\
177.0\331.0\P\5.31\6.21\allright\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
178.0\332.0\D\5.31\3.2\So  Two or three weeks. \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
178.0\333.0\D\5.31\5.4\ So go ahead and stop that today\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
179.0\334.0\P\5.31\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\3.0\\\\R\
180.0\335.0\D\5.31\3.6\Okay?  \1.0\3.0\\\\R\
180.0\336.0\D\5.31\2.2\Or tonight I don't know when you last took the Videx.\11.0\3.0\\\\R\2.1
181.0\337.0\P\3.3\2.121\Uh, I'm gotta pick up my prescription today, \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
181.0\338.0\P\3.3\3.2\so let's just\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
182.0\339.0\D\3.3\5.4\Just tell them you're not gonna pick it up.\9.0\3.0\\\\P\
183.0\340.0\P\3.3\6.21\Okay.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
184.0\341.0\D\3.3\5.4\Say we're gonna stop that. Okay? \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
184.0\342.0\D\3.3\6.2\ And we'll tell the pharmacy too. \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
184.0\343.0\D\5.31\5.4\ So go ahead as of today, \6.0\3.0\\\\R\
184.0\344.0\D\3.0\6.2\that means in about two weeks, I'm gonna check it again. \11.0\3.0\\\\P\
184.0\345.0\D\3.0\3.6\ All right? \2.0\3.0\\\\P\
184.0\346.0\D\3.0\2.121\ No I'm gonna say three weeks\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
185.0\347.0\P\3.0\3.1\ok\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
186.0\348.0\D\3.0\5.3\we'll go a little longer.\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
187.0\349.0\P\3.0\1.122\Three weeks to make another\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
188.0\350.0\D\3.0\5.3\Three weeks we're gonna make a lab appointment.\8.0\3.0\\\\P\
189.0\351.0\P\3.0\1.122\right here?\2.0\3.0\\\\P\
190.0\352.0\D\3.0\2.121\Just a lab.  Just a lab. \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
190.0\353.0\D\3.0\6.2\And then I'm gonna call you about the results.\9.0\3.0\\\\P\
191.0\354.0\P\3.0\6.21\All right.\2.0\3.0\\\\P\
192.0\355.0\D\5.31\2.121\So, then we're gonna recheck to see if the viral level stays\12.0\3.0\\\\P\
193.0\356.0\P\5.31\2.132\Stable.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
194.0\357.0\D\5.31\11.0\Less than 50. \3.0\3.0\\\\P\
194.0\358.0\D\5.31\2.43\ Stable, exactly.  \2.0\3.0\\\\P\
194.0\359.0\D\5.2\2.14\And the whole reason for this, is to reduce the side effect which we're starting to see, \17.0\3.0\\\\P\
194.0\360.0\D\5.2\2.14\which is the facial fat thinning. \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
194.0\361.0\D\5.2\2.14\ The layer of fat that we all have.\8.0\3.0\\\\P\
195.0\362.0\P\5.2\1.121\So if I stop taking, my face is coming back?\10.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\363.0\D\5.2\2.13\Usually it slowly, slowly gets a little better. \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\364.0\D\5.2\2.12\ It may never come back completely, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\365.0\D\5.2\2.121\but it will stop getting worse, okay? \7.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\366.0\D\5.2\2.4\ Cuz it's not very noticeable now, \6.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\367.0\D\5.2\82.0\but if we kept going, I think it's going to start to get, \13.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\368.0\D\5.31\2.121\if we see this start to come up, then we're gonna have to decide what medicine to use. \18.0\3.0\\\\P\
196.0\369.0\D\5.31\2.121\ But I think we'll avoid the Videx.\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
197.0\370.0\P\5.31\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
198.0\371.0\D\5.31\3.1\Okay.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
199.0\372.0\P\5.31\2.4\I definitely I want to.\5.0\3.0\\\\P\
200.0\373.0\D\5.31\2.45\Right, \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
200.0\374.0\D\5.2\2.45\because we're starting to see that.\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
201.0\375.0\P\5.2\2.42\[4w] it's great that you told me that, \8.0\3.0\\\\P\
201.0\376.0\P\5.2\2.42\cuz I really don't uh uh, it gets me, you know the praise that I feel.  \16.0\3.0\\\\P\
201.0\377.0\P\5.2\2.4\I want to hear something like that\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
202.0\378.0\D\5.2\3.6\right\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
203.0\379.0\P\5.2\82.0\I feel like\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
204.0\380.0\D\5.2\3.6\Right.  \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
204.0\381.0\D\5.2\4.1\It's one more thing that you have to be thinking about. \11.0\3.0\\\\P\
204.0\382.0\D\6.0\3.5\ Now [name of staff] mentioned to me that you were interested to know about could you keep some antibiotic at home in case your skin\25.0\4.0\antibiotic\4.51\P\P\
205.0\383.0\P\6.0\2.5\Yeah, just like [3w], \4.0\4.0\\\\P\
205.0\384.0\P\6.0\2.4\cuz I think that instead of the same thing, it's coming this, you know, this\15.0\4.0\\\\P\
206.0\385.0\D\6.0\1.121\Cellulitis?\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
207.0\386.0\P\6.0\2.13\Cellulitis, right.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
208.0\387.0\D\6.0\2.45\Yeah, it's interesting, \3.0\4.0\\\\P\
208.0\388.0\D\6.0\2.45\cuz when I look back, you're right that you tend to get it at around this time of year, \19.0\4.0\\\\P\
208.0\389.0\D\6.0\2.14\although you've also had it in the winter.\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
209.0\390.0\P\6.0\3.1\yeah\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
210.0\391.0\D\6.0\3.2\Um, \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
210.0\392.0\D\6.0\2.14\and the fall you've had it a lot.  \8.0\4.0\\\\P\
210.0\393.0\D\6.0\2.5\The key, the most important thing is you have to be smart about when to use it, \17.0\4.0\\\\P\
210.0\394.0\D\6.0\2.121\because if we use antibiotics too much\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
211.0\395.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
212.0\396.0\D\6.0\11.0\Then we can actually have problems with bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic.\14.0\4.0\\\\P\
213.0\397.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\398.0\D\6.0\2.121\That the antibiotic won't work. \5.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\399.0\D\6.0\5.3\ We want to use it when we need it, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\400.0\D\6.0\5.3\not because we worry that we might need it.  \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\401.0\D\6.0\2.14\So you know the feeling, \5.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\402.0\D\6.0\2.14\and you know the look of when you start to get that. \12.0\4.0\\\\P\
214.0\403.0\D\6.0\2.5\ So what I'd like you to do\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
215.0\404.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
216.0\405.0\D\6.0\5.4\Is, when you start it, to call and tell us that you've started the antibiotic, okay?\16.0\4.0\\\\P\
217.0\406.0\P\6.0\3.1\Mhm.  Mhm.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
218.0\407.0\D\6.0\6.2\So I'm gonna give you the prescription, \7.0\4.0\\\\R\
218.0\408.0\D\6.0\5.6\you keep the medicine at home.  \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
218.0\409.0\D\6.0\5.4\When you realize\3.0\4.0\\\\P\
219.0\410.0\P\6.0\3.6\right\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\411.0\D\6.0\11.0\that's starting, you call and tell us, \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\412.0\D\6.0\2.121\and then we'll just decide,   Well, depending on how it's going, do we need to look at,   make sure that it's okay, \22.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\413.0\D\6.0\2.5\but at least you get to start it when you know you need it. \14.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\414.0\D\1.14\2.14\ And in the past when you've known, it's been because you start to get the redness, \16.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\415.0\D\1.14\2.14\the pain, \2.0\4.0\\\\P\
220.0\416.0\D\1.14\2.14\and some swelling in that leg.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
221.0\417.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mhm. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
221.0\418.0\P\1.14\2.1\ The uh when I realize that I feel this pain\10.0\4.0\\\\P\
222.0\419.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yes.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
223.0\420.0\P\1.14\11.0\Is that the pain has started right here.\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
224.0\421.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
224.0\422.0\D\1.14\2.14\ It's a very distinct feeling when you get that.\9.0\4.0\\\\P\
225.0\423.0\P\1.14\3.6\yes\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
226.0\424.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
227.0\425.0\P\1.14\2.1\I can feel that my leg is getting, you know, you can't straight out your arm.\16.0\4.0\\\\P\
228.0\426.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
228.0\427.0\D\1.14\2.1\ English we say  extended\4.0\4.0\\\\P\
229.0\428.0\P\1.14\2.131\Extended.  Extended.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
230.0\429.0\D\1.14\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
231.0\430.0\P\1.14\2.1\Um, okay you can't extend it.  Extend it. \8.0\4.0\\\\P\
231.0\431.0\P\1.14\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
232.0\432.0\D\1.14\3.6\Uh huh.  Uh huh.\4.0\4.0\\\\P\
233.0\433.0\P\1.14\2.63\[Laughing].  \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
233.0\434.0\P\1.14\3.2\So um, \2.0\4.0\\\\P\
233.0\435.0\P\1.14\2.62\and uh when you try to extend it, it feels pain right here, \13.0\4.0\\\\P\
233.0\436.0\P\1.14\2.62\and almost very close to the bone.\7.0\4.0\\\\P\
234.0\437.0\D\1.14\3.6\mhm mhm\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
235.0\438.0\P\1.14\1.121\It's called the joint, right?\5.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\439.0\D\1.14\2.13\Yeah. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\440.0\D\1.14\2.45\ I think it's interesting in your case you always get that feeling, \12.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\441.0\D\1.14\2.1\even though the infection ends up being more in the skin, \11.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\442.0\D\1.14\2.1\and just below the skin, \5.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\443.0\D\1.14\2.1\we call cellulitis. \3.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\444.0\D\1.14\2.12\ But I think it's because the first sign that you have of it is that your lymph system is getting inflamed, \21.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\445.0\D\1.14\2.12\and I think that's why you get that feeling way up here, um, \13.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\446.0\D\1.14\2.1\because you also have problems with the lymph, \8.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\447.0\D\1.14\2.1\every since that surgery, that lymph doesn't drain well, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\448.0\D\1.14\2.1\and so you get a backup, \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\449.0\D\1.14\2.1\and when you get infection, you get more swelling \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
236.0\450.0\D\1.14\2.1\and more pain there.\4.0\4.0\\\\P\
237.0\451.0\P\1.14\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
238.0\452.0\D\6.0\6.2\Okay, so I'm gonna give you a prescription for the antibiotic that we've used before that's been successful, and\19.0\4.0\\\\R\
239.0\453.0\P\6.0\2.11\And like I was coming with my partner \8.0\4.0\\\\P\
239.0\454.0\P\6.0\2.11\uh that was a couple of days that uh, uh that I was talking about it, the same thing, with the uh, telling him that might be a good idea, \30.0\4.0\\\\P\
239.0\455.0\P\6.0\2.5\so you know it'll save me a trip\8.0\4.0\\\\P\
240.0\456.0\D\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
241.0\457.0\P\6.0\11.0\To the hospital\3.0\4.0\\\\P\
242.0\458.0\D\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
243.0\459.0\P\6.0\2.5\And stay there five, six days\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
244.0\460.0\D\6.0\3.1\Mhm.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
245.0\461.0\P\6.0\2.5\And then I will save money for the insurance for the hospital, \12.0\4.0\\\\P\
245.0\462.0\P\6.0\2.5\and for, you know, for everybody.\6.0\4.0\\\\P\
246.0\463.0\D\6.0\2.5\Yeah but the key here is to start it when you notice it\13.0\4.0\\\\P\
247.0\464.0\P\6.0\3.6\Uh huh.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
248.0\465.0\D\6.0\5.4\But don't start it cuz you're worried that it might happen. \11.0\4.0\\\\P\
248.0\466.0\D\6.0\1.31\ You understand?\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
249.0\467.0\P\6.0\2.2\No it's just, yeah, \4.0\4.0\\\\P\
249.0\468.0\P\6.0\1.121\and I do that when, you know when it just starting to\12.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\469.0\D\6.0\2.13\Right.  \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\470.0\D\6.0\5.4\And then call me when that happens, \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\471.0\D\6.0\5.4\or leave a message with [name of staff], that you've started to take the antibiotic. \15.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\472.0\D\1.18\2.5\ That way we'll know that you're having that happening, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\473.0\D\1.18\2.121\and maybe we'll have you come in if we're worried, \10.0\4.0\\\\P\
250.0\474.0\D\1.18\2.121\if you say,   Oh I'm also having a fever,   that it may be it's getting worse instead of better.\19.0\4.0\\\\P\
251.0\475.0\P\1.18\3.1\Uh huh. \2.0\4.0\\\\P\
251.0\476.0\P\1.18\6.21\ I will.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
252.0\477.0\D\3.0\2.4\Cuz coming here is a lot easier than going to the hospital.\12.0\4.0\\\\P\
253.0\478.0\P\3.0\2.63\[Laughing]. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
253.0\479.0\P\3.0\3.6\ Yes.\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
254.0\480.0\D\3.0\2.4\Usually. \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
254.0\481.0\D\3.0\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\4.0\\\\P\
255.0\482.0\P\3.0\2.4\Oh I hate going to the hospital.  \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
255.0\483.0\P\3.0\2.4\I mean everybody's so nice to me, \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
255.0\484.0\P\3.0\82.1\but it's, you know, for me to go to\9.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\485.0\D\6.0\2.11\So what I wrote here is,  use the antibiotic when the leg is starting to get cellulitis, \17.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\486.0\D\6.0\2.1\   that's the word we use for that infection you've had several times. \12.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\487.0\D\6.0\3.2\ Okay?  \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\488.0\D\6.0\2.121\And it's going to be written on the bottle, \9.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\489.0\D\6.0\2.1\it's that four times a day one. \7.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\490.0\D\6.0\3.2\ Okay?  \1.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\491.0\D\6.0\3.4\So that's the prescription, \4.0\4.0\\\\R\4.2
256.0\492.0\D\6.0\5.6\so you can get that filled \6.0\4.0\\\\P\
256.0\493.0\D\6.0\5.6\and keep that in your medicine cabinet.\7.0\4.0\\\\P\

280.0\548.0\D\1.16\3.6\Two packs a week? \4.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\549.0\D\1.16\2.4\ Okay, so not too bad. \5.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\550.0\D\1.16\2.12\ You're someone who probably would do okay, you may not even need the patches, \14.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\551.0\D\1.16\2.4\because you're not smoking a whole lot. \7.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\552.0\D\1.16\5.3\ But what I want you to do is write down, when do you smoke? \14.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\553.0\D\1.16\2.1\ Like, after I get up in the morning, or when I have breakfast, or when I take a break at work, \21.0\6.0\\\\P\
280.0\554.0\D\1.16\5.3\all those different times during the day, if you can figure out why,  \13.0\6.0\\\\P\

283.0\558.0\P\1.16\2.11\always do the same\4.0\6.0\\\\P\
284.0\559.0\D\1.16\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\6.0\\\\P\
284.0\560.0\D\1.16\5.3\So you're gonna have the  When, the   Why, and then this is the part, you're gonna do,  What will I do instead?   \22.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\561.0\D\1.16\3.6\ Right?  \1.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\562.0\D\1.16\2.5\Because if you do it cuz you're bored, you need something else to take away your boredom, \17.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\563.0\D\1.16\2.1\crossword puzzles, read, go for a walk, do something, play whatever game. \12.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\564.0\D\1.16\3.6\ Okay?  \1.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\565.0\D\1.16\2.4\If you do it because you're with your friends and they offer you cigarettes, that's gonna be harder, \18.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\566.0\D\1.16\2.4\cuz what are you gonna do now if they offer you a cigarette? \13.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\567.0\D\1.16\5.1\ You need to have a plan.  Okay? \7.0\6.0\\\\R\
284.0\568.0\D\1.16\5.1\ If you do it because you're upset, and that calms you down, you need to find something else that helps to calm you down.\24.0\6.0\\\\R\
285.0\569.0\P\1.16\3.1\Mhm.  \1.0\6.0\\\\R\
285.0\570.0\P\1.16\2.1\The only thing that calm me down is, you know, having something on my mouth. \15.0\6.0\\\\R\
285.0\571.0\P\1.16\2.63\[Laughing]\1.0\6.0\\\\R\
286.0\572.0\D\1.16\5.1\Well, you need to find something else for your mouth. \10.0\6.0\\\\R\
286.0\573.0\D\1.16\2.63\[Laughing]. \1.0\6.0\\\\R\
286.0\574.0\D\1.16\5.1\ Gum, candy\2.0\6.0\\\\R\
287.0\575.0\P\1.16\3.6\candy or\2.0\6.0\\\\R\
288.0\576.0\D\1.16\5.1\little things, or other things.  \5.0\6.0\\\\R\
288.0\577.0\D\1.16\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\6.0\\\\R\
289.0\578.0\P\1.16\2.4\But that's not too good to me, \7.0\6.0\\\\R\
289.0\579.0\P\1.16\2.4\cuz if I have every time something in my mouth\10.0\6.0\\\\R\
290.0\580.0\D\1.16\3.1\mhm\1.0\6.0\\\\R\
291.0\581.0\P\1.16\11.0\it's I'll gain weight.\4.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\582.0\D\1.16\2.1\Well it depends on what it is.  \7.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\583.0\D\1.16\5.1\If it's sugarfree gum, right? \5.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\584.0\D\1.16\2.1\ It's not gonna hurt your teeth, \6.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\585.0\D\1.16\2.121\and it's not gonna cause you to gain weight.  \9.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\586.0\D\1.16\2.121\If it's uh, you know, candy, \6.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\587.0\D\1.16\2.121\and you won't stop eating, well then yeah, you might gain weight. \12.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\588.0\D\1.16\5.1\ But maybe, the other thing is when you're bored, when you do it cuz you're bored you go and you go for a walk instead of smoke and then you actually lose weight, \33.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\589.0\D\1.16\2.1\because you're being more active. \5.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\590.0\D\1.16\5.1\ Think about it, you have to think about it, \9.0\6.0\\\\R\
292.0\591.0\D\1.16\2.1\otherwise people, they try to quit, and then you know, they don't plan it \14.0\6.0\\\\I\
292.0\592.0\D\1.16\2.1\and then they come back three days later, they say,   That didn't work, I can't quit smoking.  \17.0\6.0\\\\I\
292.0\593.0\D\1.16\2.4\  But they didn't really think about it.  \7.0\6.0\\\\I\
