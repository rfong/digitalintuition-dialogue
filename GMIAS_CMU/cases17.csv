113.0\225.0\D\4.0\2.1\like he behind the elbow \S\\\\\

135.0\269.0\D\2.1\2.4\but it sounds good. \1.0\\\\P\
135.0\270.0\D\2.1\1.22\ I mean do you think this program would work for, you know\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\271.0\P\2.1\1.121\[8w] with depression\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\272.0\D\2.1\2.13\Yeah?\1.0\\\\I\
138.0\273.0\P\2.1\2.1\So they think, you know, that that was part of the [1w] \1.0\\\\I\
138.0\274.0\P\2.1\2.1\it was just selfmedicating my symptoms of depression\1.0\\\\P\
139.0\275.0\D\2.1\3.6\Depression [1w], yeah.\1.0\\\\P\
140.0\276.0\P\2.1\3.2\Yeah. \1.0\\\\P\
140.0\277.0\P\2.1\81.0\ So you know  [7w] that's antidepressants, \1.0\\\\P\
140.0\278.0\P\2.1\2.1\and like [2w] free, \1.0\\\\P\
140.0\279.0\P\2.1\2.1\they call them mental health classes, \1.0\\\\I\
140.0\280.0\P\2.1\2.1\but they're really like discussion groups\1.0\\\\I\
141.0\281.0\D\2.1\3.1\Uh huh.\1.0\\\\I\
142.0\282.0\P\2.1\2.1\And the pain management group.\1.0\\\\I\
143.0\283.0\D\2.1\1.121\So this is specifically targeted for people who have diagnosed mood disorders as well?\1.0\\\\I\
144.0\284.0\P\2.1\2.13\Mhm.  Overall, yeah.\1.0\\\\I\
145.0\285.0\D\2.1\3.6\I see.\1.0\\\\I\
146.0\286.0\P\2.1\2.1\But also they're really effective at, you know, getting you off of pot.  \1.0\\\\I\
146.0\287.0\P\2.1\2.4\I recommend that, you know, the [name of program] program.  You know.\1.0\\\\P\
147.0\288.0\D\2.1\6.2\Well I'll keep that in mind.  \1.0\\\\P\
147.0\289.0\D\2.1\2.4\That's sounds like a great lead source, \1.0\\\\P\
147.0\290.0\D\2.1\2.71\and hopefully we can help other\1.0\\\\P\
148.0\291.0\P\2.6\2.1\And then, yeah, if they have other issues, while they're there they have social worker \1.0\\\\I\
148.0\292.0\P\2.6\2.1\that works with you \1.0\\\\I\
148.0\293.0\P\2.6\2.1\and she's the one who [crosstalk 4w]\1.0\\\\I\
149.0\294.0\D\2.6\1.122\She's the one who hooked you in at [name of clinic]?\1.0\\\\I\
150.0\295.0\P\2.6\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\\\\I\
151.0\296.0\D\2.1\1.12\And how many times would you go there?\1.0\\\\P\
152.0\297.0\P\2.1\2.11\I go there five days a week.  \1.0\\\\P\
152.0\298.0\P\2.1\81.0\[5w] they want you to pull out.\1.0\\\\P\
153.0\299.0\D\2.1\3.1\Mhm\1.0\\\\P\
154.0\300.0\P\2.1\2.1\They have different levels of care for different people, \1.0\\\\I\
154.0\301.0\P\2.1\2.4\and um, but the woman totallyshe's like it's not for everyone, \1.0\\\\I\
154.0\302.0\P\2.1\2.4\cuz it's in really bad like drug neighborhood.\1.0\\\\I\
155.0\303.0\D\2.1\3.6\Oh, I see.\1.0\\\\I\
156.0\304.0\P\2.1\3.2\Yeah. \1.0\\\\I\
156.0\305.0\P\2.1\2.1\ So a lot of people, they have to walk from one building to another, like four blocks away, \1.0\\\\I\
156.0\306.0\P\2.1\82.0\gets kind of\1.0\\\\I\
157.0\307.0\D\2.1\3.1\Oh.\1.0\\\\I\
158.0\308.0\P\2.1\82.1\But\1.0\\\\I\
159.0\309.0\D\2.1\2.4\I mean it sounds to me like the people who have done it are the people who have lots of insight into what's going on\1.0\\\\I\
160.0\310.0\P\2.1\2.43\Right.\1.0\\\\I\
161.0\311.0\D\2.1\2.4\And like people who are really able to cooperate with therapies, \1.0\\\\I\
161.0\312.0\D\2.1\2.4\it sounds like they're highfunctioning people, actually, are in this.\1.0\\\\I\
162.0\313.0\P\2.1\2.4\Well there's a level of different things, \1.0\\\\I\
162.0\314.0\P\2.1\2.1\I mean there's people who are really really [3w] mental illness, like schizophrenia.\1.0\\\\I\
163.0\315.0\D\2.1\3.6\Oh I see.  Uh huh.\1.0\\\\I\
164.0\316.0\P\2.1\2.1\But there's not that many of them. \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\317.0\P\2.1\2.1\ But they refuse to have a level of functioning \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\318.0\P\2.1\2.1\because you have to be able to go from one building to another, \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\319.0\P\2.1\2.1\cuz they serve you lunch \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\320.0\P\2.1\2.1\[4w] go somewhere \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\321.0\P\2.1\2.1\and eat, \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\322.0\P\2.1\2.1\and then you come back \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\323.0\P\2.1\2.1\and go to your groups. \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\324.0\P\2.1\2.1\ And so there's like an [1w] building where they have a doctor \1.0\\\\I\
164.0\325.0\P\2.1\2.4\who's really not that effective, but\1.0\\\\I\
165.0\326.0\D\2.1\81.0\[4w].\1.0\\\\I\
166.0\327.0\P\2.1\83.0\yeah  \1.0\\\\I\
166.0\328.0\P\2.1\2.1\And then you have your pain management group over there.\1.0\\\\I\
167.0\329.0\D\2.1\3.6\Yeah. \1.0\\\\I\
167.0\330.0\D\2.1\2.4\ I mean that sounds incredible. \1.0\\\\E\
167.0\331.0\D\2.1\1.221\ So you're enjoying this, \1.0\\\\E\
167.0\332.0\D\2.1\1.221\this is really working for you?\1.0\\\\P\
168.0\333.0\P\2.1\2.4\Yes, yes, very much so.\1.0\\\\P\
169.0\334.0\D\1.14\1.12\And are you finding that the control of your mood symptoms has also improved?\4.0\antidepres\3.1\D\P\

171.0\336.0\D\1.14\82.0\That's see\4.0\\\\P\
172.0\337.0\P\1.14\81.0\I also [6w] \4.0\\\\P\
172.0\338.0\P\1.14\2.2\I don't know if it was situational versus chemical, \4.0\\\\P\
172.0\339.0\P\6.0\2.5\cuz I don't know if I want to be on antidepressants all my, \4.0\\\\P\
172.0\340.0\P\6.0\3.2\you know what I mean?\4.0\\\\P\
173.0\341.0\D\6.0\3.1\Right.\4.0\\\\P\
174.0\342.0\P\6.0\81.0\[4w] dependency on a pill again, you know. \4.0\\\\P\
174.0\343.0\P\6.0\2.5\ Sobut as I need to be off of everything for awhile to have some kind of clarity\4.0\\\\P\
175.0\344.0\D\6.0\3.1\Yeah.\4.0\\\\P\
176.0\345.0\P\6.0\3.2\If that makes any sense.\4.0\\\\P\
177.0\346.0\D\6.0\1.121\So I mean you're still on the antidepressants right now, right?\4.0\\\\P\
178.0\347.0\P\6.0\2.13\Yeah.\4.0\\\\P\
179.0\348.0\D\6.0\2.1\Yeah, I have had patients in the past who've struggled with that, \4.0\\\\I\
179.0\349.0\D\6.0\2.1\like, you know,  I'm feeling good now \4.0\\\\I\
179.0\350.0\D\6.0\2.1\and I've been feeling good for a year\4.0\\\\I\
180.0\351.0\P\6.0\3.1\mhm\4.0\\\\I\
181.0\352.0\D\6.0\2.1\or two, \4.0\\\\I\
181.0\353.0\D\6.0\2.1\and I'm wondering if actually I don't need this medication \4.0\\\\I\
181.0\354.0\D\6.0\2.1\and whether it might be doing more harm than good.\4.0\\\\I\
182.0\355.0\P\6.0\3.1\Right.\4.0\\\\I\
183.0\356.0\D\6.0\2.1\But I have to say that in some of those cases when they went off, the depression did sneak back in their lives\4.0\\\\I\
184.0\357.0\P\6.0\3.1\right\4.0\\\\I\
185.0\358.0\D\6.0\2.1\they started to feel the darkness coming on again.  \4.0\\\\I\
185.0\359.0\D\6.0\2.1\But it was so subtle \4.0\\\\I\
185.0\360.0\D\6.0\2.1\that they didn't realize that it was depression, \4.0\\\\I\
185.0\361.0\D\6.0\2.1\it was depression that was untreated. \4.0\\\\I\
185.0\362.0\D\1.14\5.1\ So I would say, let's tackle one thing at a time.\4.0\\\\R\
186.0\363.0\P\1.14\3.1\Right.\4.0\\\\R\
187.0\364.0\D\1.14\1.121\And probably that's what they were advising you at [name of clinic]. \4.0\\\\R\
187.0\365.0\D\1.14\1.121\ Let's focus on the pain, \4.0\\\\R\
187.0\366.0\D\1.14\1.121\and getting you in a situation where you're comfortable first.\4.0\\\\R\
188.0\367.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right.\4.0\\\\R\
189.0\368.0\D\1.14\1.121\And then as time goes on we can readdress the mood issues.  \4.0\\\\R\
189.0\369.0\D\1.14\2.4\I think if, you know, if you're not having to go back in the hospital for um breakthrough depression for a few months\4.0\\\\R\
190.0\370.0\P\1.14\3.1\right\4.0\\\\R\
191.0\371.0\D\1.14\11.0\then we're really making progress, \4.0\\\\R\2.1
191.0\372.0\D\1.14\2.2\cuz I know that this past six months have been really tough\4.0\\\\P\
192.0\373.0\P\1.14\3.6\yeah \4.0\\\\P\
192.0\374.0\P\1.14\2.1\And I wake up, I feel good every day \4.0\\\\P\

193.0\376.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yeah.  \4.0\\\\P\
193.0\377.0\D\2.7\1.121\And I'll ask you, you're not really working during this interval, right, \5.0\work\3.1\D\P\
193.0\378.0\D\2.7\2.12\cuz it's almost impossible to work out a schedule.\5.0\\\\P\
194.0\379.0\P\2.7\2.11\No, \5.0\\\\P\
194.0\380.0\P\2.7\2.121\it will mellow \5.0\\\\P\
194.0\381.0\P\2.7\2.121\and I'll look for something, maybe in the morning.\5.0\\\\P\
195.0\382.0\D\2.7\3.6\ok. \5.0\\\\P\
195.0\383.0\D\2.7\1.12\ Are you gonna stay in like a waitering type situation?\5.0\\\\P\
196.0\384.0\P\2.7\2.121\No, \5.0\\\\P\
196.0\385.0\P\2.7\2.5\I think I'm gonna get out of that \5.0\\\\P\
196.0\386.0\P\2.7\2.4\because, you know, it's not very conducive, \5.0\\\\P\
196.0\387.0\P\2.7\2.4\because so many people, and almost everybody in the restaurant business parties.\5.0\\\\P\

213.0\423.0\D\2.1\3.6\Okay, okay good. \6.0\\\\P\
213.0\424.0\D\2.1\1.121\ So you're not having to pay a lot of outofpocket?\6.0\\\\P\
214.0\425.0\P\2.1\2.13\No \6.0\\\\P\
214.0\426.0\P\2.1\2.1\I don't pay anything out of pocket.\6.0\\\\P\

217.0\430.0\D\2.1\2.5\I need to look into this, \6.0\\\\P\
217.0\431.0\D\2.1\2.4\cuz I mean this sounds like dynamite for many who just have no doctor's care.\6.0\\\\P\
218.0\432.0\P\2.1\2.1\They have like like over 300 people there at a time.\6.0\\\\I\

225.0\450.0\D\2.6\4.0\Well I'm sure you're gonna do well. \7.0\\\\E\
225.0\451.0\D\2.6\4.0\ [3w] anyone meeting you would see that you would succeed.  \7.0\\\\E\
225.0\452.0\D\2.6\2.65\That's perfect.\7.0\\\\E\
226.0\453.0\P\2.6\3.2\Yeah, \7.0\\\\E\
226.0\454.0\P\2.6\2.1\and you get a certain amount of money [2w] your grades up.\7.0\\\\E\
227.0\455.0\D\2.6\3.6\Yeah. \7.0\\\\I\
227.0\456.0\D\2.6\1.22\ Does that sound like the direction you want to move in?\7.0\\\\I\
228.0\457.0\P\2.6\2.5\Yeah, \7.0\\\\P\
228.0\458.0\P\2.6\2.121\I'm gonna meet with this guy named [name] \7.0\\\\P\

229.0\460.0\D\2.6\3.1\Yeah.\7.0\\\\P\
230.0\461.0\P\2.6\3.2\Yeah.\7.0\\\\P\
231.0\462.0\D\2.6\2.65\That sounds great. \7.0\\\\E\
231.0\463.0\D\2.6\3.4\ All right. \7.0\\\\P\
231.0\464.0\D\1.13\2.14\ Well you know, one thing that I may have mentioned to you last time that [2w] pick up on, you know, is your T cells dropped a little bit when you were suddenly ill\8.0\test results\4.2\D\P\
232.0\465.0\P\1.13\3.1\Right.\8.0\\\\P\
233.0\466.0\D\1.13\81.0\[2w] illness, \8.0\\\\P\
233.0\467.0\D\1.13\2.7\and as I predicted \8.0\\\\P\
233.0\468.0\D\1.13\2.1\it came back up, you know, after your illness subsided.\8.0\\\\P\
234.0\469.0\P\1.13\1.12\What was it again?\8.0\\\\P\
235.0\470.0\D\1.13\2.1\It came up to 400, over 400, \8.0\\\\P\
235.0\471.0\D\1.13\2.1\it was 431.\8.0\\\\P\
236.0\472.0\P\1.13\3.6\Oh okay.\8.0\\\\P\
237.0\473.0\D\1.13\2.4\I'm sure it's even higher now. \8.0\\\\P\
237.0\474.0\D\1.13\5.1\ Why don't we recheck it today, \8.0\\\\R\
237.0\475.0\D\1.13\82.0\but you know, just given what we know about this history of your disease, you're probably, \8.0\\\\P\
237.0\476.0\D\5.33\2.4\I don't suspect that you'll need antiretrovirals for more than a year.\8.0\\\\P\
238.0\477.0\P\5.33\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\P\
239.0\478.0\D\5.33\2.1\So, we're even talking years here. \8.0\\\\P\
239.0\479.0\D\5.33\2.1\ We're kind of in this surveillance phase, \8.0\\\\P\
239.0\480.0\D\1.13\2.5\where we just want to make sure that that T cell count remains nice and high \8.0\\\\P\
239.0\481.0\D\1.14\2.5\and you're still feeling healthy all the time.\8.0\\\\P\
240.0\482.0\P\1.13\1.12\What is the highest it was?  Was it 6, 700?\8.0\\\\P\
241.0\483.0\D\1.13\2.1\Yeah.  \8.0\\\\P\
241.0\484.0\D\1.13\2.1\ O  year and this year you were 585, \8.0\\\\P\
241.0\485.0\D\1.13\2.1\you were 646 after that in July. \8.0\\\\P\
241.0\486.0\D\1.13\2.1\ You know these counts are variable in everybody.\8.0\\\\I\
242.0\487.0\P\1.13\3.1\hmm\8.0\\\\I\
243.0\488.0\D\1.13\2.1\So you're never gonna have the exact same count.\8.0\\\\I\
244.0\489.0\P\1.1\1.121\it's replicating themselves like a billion times a day in your blood, the HIV?\8.0\\\\I\
245.0\490.0\D\1.1\1.122\The HIV?  \8.0\\\\I\
245.0\491.0\D\1.1\2.1\Yeah, \8.0\\\\I\
245.0\492.0\D\1.1\2.4\it's an interesting thing, \8.0\\\\I\
245.0\493.0\D\1.1\2.1\because um the kinetics are, or, you know, that's kind of the signs of your time, \8.0\\\\I\
245.0\494.0\D\1.1\2.1\the rate at which the HIV multiplies is quite dramatic\8.0\\\\I\
246.0\495.0\P\1.1\3.1\Mhm.\8.0\\\\I\
247.0\496.0\D\1.13\2.1\But we actually don't see the plasma viral load\8.0\\\\I\
248.0\497.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhm.\8.0\\\\I\
249.0\498.0\D\1.13\11.0\Increase at that trajectory. \8.0\\\\I\
249.0\499.0\D\1.1\2.1\ And the reason is that your body actually has some immune response\8.0\\\\I\
250.0\500.0\P\1.1\3.1\mhm\8.0\\\\I\
251.0\501.0\D\1.1\11.0\to the HIV.\8.0\\\\I\
252.0\502.0\P\1.1\3.1\Mhm.\8.0\\\\I\
253.0\503.0\D\1.1\2.1\It's not enough to wipe out every infected cell\8.0\\\\I\
254.0\504.0\P\1.1\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\I\
255.0\505.0\D\1.1\2.1\Cuz as you know, the HIV kind of lives inside cells where it hides.\8.0\\\\I\
256.0\506.0\P\1.1\3.1\Right.\8.0\\\\I\
257.0\507.0\D\1.1\2.1\And the body's not good enough to pick it out of all of those cells\8.0\\\\I\
258.0\508.0\P\1.1\3.1\Right.\8.0\\\\I\
259.0\509.0\D\1.1\2.1\Because most of them look healthy. \8.0\\\\I\
259.0\510.0\D\1.1\2.1\ But it's good enough to not down the rate of replication to the point that actually the rate of replication, more or less, is in balance with the rate of elimination\8.0\\\\I\
260.0\511.0\P\1.1\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\I\
261.0\512.0\D\1.1\11.0\For a long period of time. \8.0\\\\I\
261.0\513.0\D\1.1\2.1\ Ultimately, for reasons we don't really understand, usually anywhere between five and ten years down the line, the rate of replication really starts to outpace the ability of the body's immune system to hold it in check\8.0\\\\I\
262.0\514.0\P\1.1\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\I\
263.0\515.0\D\1.1\2.1\So those antibodies \8.0\\\\I\
263.0\516.0\D\1.1\2.1\and those T cells become less effective, \8.0\\\\I\
263.0\517.0\D\1.1\2.1\the virus gets more virulent, \8.0\\\\I\
263.0\518.0\D\1.1\2.1\it starts to knock down T cells \8.0\\\\I\
263.0\519.0\D\1.1\2.1\and cause more inflammation, \8.0\\\\I\
263.0\520.0\D\1.13\2.1\and that's when we start to see your T cell count really start to drop at a fast rate.\8.0\\\\I\
264.0\521.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\I\
265.0\522.0\D\5.33\2.1\Um you know Where we are right now, you know, about two to four years ago we would have said,  We're only gonna treat you if your T cell count falls below 200\8.0\\\\I\
266.0\523.0\P\5.33\3.1\Mhm.\8.0\\\\I\
267.0\524.0\D\5.33\2.1\We're much more aggressive and proactive now.  \8.0\\\\I\
267.0\525.0\D\1.13\2.1\If we see that you have a high viral load, \8.0\\\\I\
267.0\526.0\D\1.13\2.1\or if we see that your T cell count's fallen around 350 \8.0\\\\I\
267.0\527.0\D\1.13\2.1\or lower\8.0\\\\I\
268.0\528.0\P\1.13\3.1\Mhm.\8.0\\\\I\
269.0\529.0\D\5.33\11.0\We start it even sooner.\8.0\\\\I\
270.0\530.0\P\5.33\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\I\
271.0\531.0\D\5.33\2.5\Just cuz we don't want to get into that gray area\8.0\\\\I\
272.0\532.0\P\5.33\3.1\Right.\8.0\\\\I\
273.0\533.0\D\1.1\2.5\We want to keep you healthy \8.0\\\\P\
273.0\534.0\D\1.1\2.1\like you are now.\8.0\\\\P\
274.0\535.0\P\1.1\2.66\Good.\8.0\\\\P\
275.0\536.0\D\1.13\2.1\So you're not in that range, \8.0\\\\P\
275.0\537.0\D\1.13\2.1\and you probably won't be in that range for quite a while.\8.0\\\\P\
276.0\538.0\P\5.33\1.12\[3w] a lot of side effects from this [3w]?\9.0\side effects\3.1\P\I\
277.0\539.0\D\5.33\2.1\There are some side effects, \9.0\\\\R\
277.0\540.0\D\5.33\82.0\but you now\9.0\\\\R\
278.0\541.0\P\5.33\81.0\[3w].\9.0\\\\81.0\
279.0\542.0\D\5.33\83.0\Yeah, \9.0\\\\83.0\
279.0\543.0\D\5.33\2.1\I mean the drugs are getting better.\9.0\\\\R\
280.0\544.0\P\5.33\3.1\right\9.0\\\\R\
281.0\545.0\D\5.33\2.1\And just to give you a sense, there are a few drugs in development now that activate, \9.0\\\\R\
281.0\546.0\D\5.33\2.1\there are more antiretrovirals in development than there are antibiotics, currently. \9.0\\\\R\
281.0\547.0\D\5.33\2.1\ So there's tons and tons of new drugs coming out [2w], \9.0\\\\R\
281.0\548.0\D\5.33\2.1\and the great thing about a lot of these new drugs is that some of them are actually more effective than the ones we currently have\9.0\\\\R\
282.0\549.0\P\5.33\3.1\Okay.\9.0\\\\R\
283.0\550.0\D\5.33\2.1\And they have the side effect of candy.  You know, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\551.0\D\5.33\2.65\so it's perfect. \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\552.0\D\5.33\2.1\ One in particular, it's called integrase inhibitor, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\553.0\D\5.33\2.1\it's going to be approved, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\554.0\D\5.33\2.4\actually I think it's been FDA approved, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\555.0\D\5.33\2.1\cuz it's proven in trial that it's very safe \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\556.0\D\5.33\2.4\and it's very effective.  \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\557.0\D\5.33\2.121\And eventually people will be taking this, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\558.0\D\5.33\2.4\and it'll seem like water. \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\559.0\D\5.33\2.43\ So you're right, \9.0\\\\R\
283.0\560.0\D\5.33\2.1\some of the antiretrovirals that we've come to use [crosstalk 4w]\9.0\\\\R\
284.0\561.0\P\5.33\81.0\[Crosstalk 5w] [10w].\9.0\\\\81.0\
285.0\562.0\D\5.33\3.6\Yeah, \9.0\\\\R\
285.0\563.0\D\5.33\2.12\by the time that you need therapy, probably we're gonna have very good \9.0\\\\R\
285.0\564.0\D\5.33\2.12\and very safe responses\9.0\\\\R\
286.0\565.0\P\5.33\3.1\Okay.\9.0\\\\R\
287.0\566.0\D\5.33\2.1\But that being said, even the antiretrovirals that we currently have at our disposal are very safe \9.0\\\\R\
287.0\567.0\D\5.33\2.1\and very effective, \9.0\\\\R\
287.0\568.0\D\5.33\2.1\and although some of them do have side effects, \9.0\\\\R\
287.0\569.0\D\5.33\2.1\the majority of my patients \9.0\\\\R\
287.0\570.0\D\5.33\83.0\who are sitting up in chairs, \9.0\\\\R\
287.0\571.0\D\5.33\2.1\they're doing just fine.\9.0\\\\R\
288.0\572.0\P\5.33\3.1\Okay.\9.0\\\\R\

289.0\574.0\D\5.33\4.0\So I mean that's just reassurance for you. \9.0\\\\R\
289.0\575.0\D\5.33\2.12\ I don't expect side effects will be [4w] four year, when we have to start treating you.\9.0\\\\R\

291.0\577.0\D\5.33\11.0\So.\9.0\\\\R\

294.0\581.0\P\3.1\3.1\Okay.\X\\\\\
295.0\582.0\D\3.0\2.121\And then probably we'll just resend those labs, \8.0\\\\R\
295.0\583.0\D\3.0\2.121\just to make sure the T cell counts are high.\8.0\\\\R\
296.0\584.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\8.0\\\\R\
297.0\585.0\D\3.0\2.121\I expect that we'll do that three to four times a year.\8.0\\\\R\

309.0\611.0\D\1.14\1.121\Your mouth is in good condition?\C\\\\\
310.0\612.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yep.\C\\\\\
311.0\613.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay, \C\\\\\
311.0\614.0\D\3.1\6.12\let me take a look inside. . . . \X\\\\\
311.0\615.0\D\3.1\3.2\Okay, \X\\\\\
311.0\616.0\D\3.1\5.4\lift up your tongue. \X\\\\\
311.0\617.0\D\1.14\2.14\ Now you were mentioning still occasional clicking \2.0\\\\P\
311.0\618.0\D\1.14\2.14\and some stiffness in the shoulder. \2.0\\\\P\
311.0\619.0\D\1.14\1.12\ they've been going on for how long [2w]?\2.0\\\\P\
312.0\620.0\P\1.14\2.1\About a month now.\2.0\\\\P\
313.0\621.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay. \2.0\\\\P\
313.0\622.0\D\1.14\1.12\ And uh do you recall a month or two ago doing a lot of repetitive motion with this? \2.0\\\\P\
313.0\623.0\D\1.14\1.12\ Typing, \2.0\\\\P\
313.0\624.0\D\1.14\1.12\gardening?\2.0\\\\P\
314.0\625.0\P\1.14\2.11\No.\2.0\\\\P\
315.0\626.0\D\1.14\1.12\Bench work \2.0\\\\P\
315.0\627.0\D\1.14\1.12\or fixit jobs?  \2.0\\\\P\
315.0\628.0\D\1.14\3.6\ No?  Okay. \2.0\\\\P\
315.0\629.0\D\1.14\82.0\ So fights, \2.0\\\\P\
315.0\630.0\D\1.14\1.121\no, no, when you work out, you don't use a punching bag or anything?\2.0\\\\P\
316.0\631.0\P\1.14\2.11\No.\2.0\\\\P\
317.0\632.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay.  \2.0\\\\P\
317.0\633.0\D\1.14\1.12\And the tenderness begins where, around here?\2.0\\\\P\
318.0\634.0\P\1.14\2.1\Right in here.  It's like it's right there\2.0\\\\P\
319.0\635.0\D\1.14\3.1\mhm\2.0\\\\P\
320.0\636.0\P\1.14\2.1\and then only when I lift my thumb.  \2.0\\\\P\
320.0\637.0\P\1.14\2.4\I mean it's gotten a lot better.\2.0\\\\P\
321.0\638.0\D\1.14\1.12\Does it hurt when I [2w]?\2.0\\\\P\
322.0\639.0\P\1.14\2.1\No, \2.0\\\\P\
322.0\640.0\P\1.14\3.7\but it's, like I said, \2.0\\\\P\
322.0\641.0\P\1.14\2.1\it's hypersensitive.\2.0\\\\P\
323.0\642.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
324.0\643.0\P\1.14\2.1\Right there is where it starts getting numb.\2.0\\\\P\
325.0\644.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yeah.  \2.0\\\\P\
325.0\645.0\D\1.12\4.0\Well, let me reassure you, \2.0\\\\E\
325.0\646.0\D\1.12\2.1\it's not coming from the neck\2.0\\\\R\
326.0\647.0\P\1.12\2.66\Good.\2.0\\\\R\
327.0\648.0\D\1.12\2.1\It has nothing to do with the neck arthritis.  \2.0\\\\R\
327.0\649.0\D\1.12\2.1\So this is not what we call a brachial plexopathy.\2.0\\\\R\
328.0\650.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
329.0\651.0\D\1.12\2.1\Or cervical radiopathy \2.0\\\\R\
329.0\652.0\D\1.12\2.1\that's what you had in the shoulder.\2.0\\\\R\
330.0\653.0\P\1.12\3.1\Right.\2.0\\\\R\
331.0\654.0\D\1.12\2.1\Because if that were the case, then you would be having symptoms in a much broader distribution.\2.0\\\\R\
332.0\655.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
333.0\656.0\D\1.12\2.1\The back of your hand, \2.0\\\\R\
333.0\657.0\D\1.12\2.1\other fingers would be involved.\2.0\\\\R\
334.0\658.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
335.0\659.0\D\1.12\2.4\The fact that it's so peripheral here, probably means that we're dealing with a peripheral nerve.\2.0\\\\R\
336.0\660.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
337.0\661.0\D\1.12\2.1\So one of the small branches, \2.0\\\\R\
337.0\662.0\D\1.12\2.4\or we're dealing with a tendon, \2.0\\\\R\
337.0\663.0\D\1.12\2.4\which is most likely what this is.\2.0\\\\R\
338.0\664.0\P\1.12\3.1\All right.\2.0\\\\R\
339.0\665.0\D\1.12\2.1\All of this is pretty characteristically in uh, in uh the tendon that involves the flexion of the thumb\2.0\\\\R\
340.0\666.0\P\1.12\3.1\Right.\2.0\\\\R\
341.0\667.0\D\1.12\2.1\We had it the abductor pollicis.\2.0\\\\R\
342.0\668.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
343.0\669.0\D\1.12\2.4\And I think you have a discharacteristic symptom called dequervain's tenosynovitis.  \2.0\\\\R\
343.0\670.0\D\1.12\2.1\This is just a very common injury, \2.0\\\\R\
343.0\671.0\D\1.12\2.4\and I think, \2.0\\\\R\1.1
343.0\672.0\D\1.12\2.1\because the wrist is just so important to so many activities, \2.0\\\\P\
343.0\673.0\D\1.12\11.0\you may not have even noticed the repetitive stress you were applying either holding something \2.0\\\\P\
343.0\674.0\D\1.12\2.4\or carrying something around.\2.0\\\\P\
344.0\675.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\P\
345.0\676.0\D\6.0\1.12\What are you taking for this right now?  You got Motrin for this?\2.0\\\\P\
346.0\677.0\P\6.0\2.11\Yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
347.0\678.0\D\6.0\1.12\And what dose are you taking it in? \2.0\\\\P\
347.0\679.0\D\6.0\1.12\ How many times a day?\2.0\\\\P\
348.0\680.0\P\6.0\2.11\Maybe three.\2.0\\\\P\
349.0\681.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay.  \2.0\\\\P\
349.0\682.0\D\6.0\5.1\I think it's uh, you should be taking that exactly three times a day, \2.0\\\\R\
349.0\683.0\D\6.0\5.1\like every day I would take it if you can, when you wake up \2.0\\\\R\
349.0\684.0\D\6.0\5.1\in the midafternoon, \2.0\\\\R\
349.0\685.0\D\6.0\5.1\and before you go to bed\2.0\\\\R\
350.0\686.0\P\6.0\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
351.0\687.0\D\1.14\5.4\Cuz this inflammation, we just need to stop it.\2.0\\\\R\
352.0\688.0\P\1.14\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
353.0\689.0\D\1.14\5.4\We need to curtail it immediately \2.0\\\\R\
353.0\690.0\D\1.14\5.4\and keep it down \2.0\\\\R\
353.0\691.0\D\1.14\5.4\so that this can heal.  \2.0\\\\R\
353.0\692.0\D\1.18\5.1\And if you can prevent this sort of motion\2.0\\\\R\
354.0\693.0\P\1.18\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
355.0\694.0\D\1.18\5.1\Or this sort of motion with your thumb, \2.0\\\\R\
355.0\695.0\D\1.18\2.121\if you can prevent this wrist and this thumb motion as much as possible, this will probably heal up just fine.\2.0\\\\R\
356.0\696.0\P\1.18\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\2.1
357.0\697.0\D\1.14\1.12\Does it hurt to shake my hand?\2.0\\\\P\
358.0\698.0\P\1.14\2.1\A little, sometimes.\2.0\\\\P\
359.0\699.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yeah, \2.0\\\\P\
359.0\700.0\D\1.14\1.121\it's probably because of the thumb movement, right?\2.0\\\\P\
360.0\701.0\P\1.14\2.13\Yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
361.0\702.0\D\1.12\3.2\Anyway, \2.0\\\\P\
361.0\703.0\D\1.12\2.1\the joints themselves are fine, \2.0\\\\R\
361.0\704.0\D\1.14\2.1\and you definitely don't have any risk of arthritis.\2.0\\\\R\
362.0\705.0\P\1.14\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
363.0\706.0\D\1.12\82.1\But yeah, I do think what we're dealing with here is\2.0\\\\R\
364.0\707.0\P\1.14\2.1\Like it's burning \2.0\\\\P\
364.0\708.0\P\1.14\2.1\and that, it gets numb.\2.0\\\\P\
365.0\709.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
366.0\710.0\P\1.14\3.2\Yeah.\2.0\\\\P\
367.0\711.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yeah, \2.0\\\\P\
367.0\712.0\D\1.12\2.4\I don't think it's the radial nerve, \2.0\\\\R\
367.0\713.0\D\1.12\2.4\cuz then we'd be having trouble with much of the hand\2.0\\\\R\
368.0\714.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
369.0\715.0\D\1.12\2.4\And much of the forearm here.\2.0\\\\R\
370.0\716.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
371.0\717.0\D\1.14\2.4\The finger \2.0\\\\P\
371.0\718.0\D\1.14\2.4\and the joints look fine. \2.0\\\\P\
371.0\719.0\D\3.1\5.4\ Okay.  Just relax, \X\\\\\
371.0\720.0\D\3.1\6.12\I'm gonna [2w].\X\\\\\
372.0\721.0\P\3.1\3.1\Okay.\X\\\\\
373.0\722.0\D\1.14\1.12\Does it hurt then?\2.0\\\\P\
374.0\723.0\P\1.14\2.1\No, \2.0\\\\P\
374.0\724.0\P\1.14\2.1\it doesn't hurt when somebody's pulling me\2.0\\\\P\
375.0\725.0\D\1.14\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\P\
376.0\726.0\P\1.14\82.0\It's just when it's like\2.0\\\\P\
377.0\727.0\D\1.14\1.121\When your [2w]?\2.0\\\\P\
378.0\728.0\P\1.14\2.13\Right, \2.0\\\\P\
378.0\729.0\P\1.14\2.1\when I [3w].\2.0\\\\P\
379.0\730.0\D\3.1\6.12\[2w] let me take a look at your [1w]. \X\\\\\
379.0\731.0\D\1.14\2.1\ You know, this side is just a lot less swollen. \2.0\\\\P\
379.0\732.0\D\1.11\1.22\ Do you think you, I mean will you deal with that fine, you know, the [name of program] program if we keep this, you know, from, bandage it up for you?\2.0\\\\R\
380.0\733.0\P\1.11\2.4\Yeah.\2.0\\\\R\
381.0\734.0\D\1.11\3.6\All right. \2.0\\\\R\
381.0\735.0\D\3.0\2.121\ Maybe I can find an ace bandage for you \2.0\\\\R\
381.0\736.0\D\3.0\5.1\and you can just wrap this.\2.0\\\\R\
382.0\737.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
383.0\738.0\D\1.18\5.1\I would probably not use heat on this\2.0\\\\R\
384.0\739.0\P\1.18\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
385.0\740.0\D\1.18\82.0\If you have to, I would, \2.0\\\\R\
385.0\741.0\D\1.18\5.1\if it's really hurting you, I would probably use cold\2.0\\\\R\
386.0\742.0\P\1.18\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
387.0\743.0\D\1.18\11.0\Cold compress. . . . \2.0\\\\R\
387.0\744.0\D\1.18\81.0\Just [6w] a little bit.\2.0\\\\R\
388.0\745.0\P\1.18\3.1\Okay. . . . . . . .\2.0\\\\R\2.1
389.0\746.0\D\1.14\3.4\Yeah, \2.0\\\\R\
389.0\747.0\D\1.1\2.121\let me look up the description of the dequervain, \2.0\\\\P\
389.0\748.0\D\1.1\2.1\it's pretty uh characteristic syndrome. . . . \2.0\\\\I\
389.0\749.0\D\1.1\5.1\And can read it for you \2.0\\\\P\
389.0\750.0\D\1.1\5.1\and see if it sounds like that's what we're dealing with.  \2.0\\\\P\
389.0\751.0\D\1.1\2.1\I've actually never diagnosed anybody with this before.  \2.0\\\\P\
389.0\752.0\D\1.1\2.1\It's very common. \2.0\\\\I\
389.0\753.0\D\1.1\2.1\ So \2.0\\\\I\
389.0\754.0\D\99.0\99.0\[reading]  \2.0\\\\99.0\
389.0\755.0\D\1.1\11.0\ dequervain tenosynovitis refers to inflammation of the abductor pollicis longus,  \2.0\\\\R\
389.0\756.0\D\1.1\2.1\it's a very complicated term for the muscle that basically extends \2.0\\\\R\
389.0\757.0\D\1.1\2.1\and straightens up the thumb.\2.0\\\\R\
390.0\758.0\P\1.1\3.1\Oh.\2.0\\\\R\
391.0\759.0\D\1.1\2.1\It's cumulative movement disorder due to chronic overuse of the wrist and hand .\2.0\\\\R\
392.0\760.0\P\1.1\81.0\[6w].\2.0\\\\R\
393.0\761.0\D\1.1\83.0\Yeah.  \2.0\\\\R\
393.0\762.0\D\1.1\2.1\So usually [2w].  \2.0\\\\R\
393.0\763.0\D\1.1\2.1\ They typically end up pain at the radial side of the wrist, \2.0\\\\R\
393.0\764.0\D\1.1\2.1\meaning this side of the wrist during pinch grasping \2.0\\\\R\
393.0\765.0\D\1.1\2.1\or thumb and wrist movement .\2.0\\\\R\
394.0\766.0\P\1.1\3.1\Uh huh.\2.0\\\\R\
395.0\767.0\D\1.1\2.1\Pain may radiate to the thumb, \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\768.0\D\1.1\2.1\or up the palmar aspect of the wrist. \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\769.0\D\1.1\2.1\ Patient may complain of difficulty gripping, \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\770.0\D\1.1\2.1\often rubs over the radial styloid when describing the condition like this. \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\771.0\D\1.1\2.1\ So usually diagnose it by asking the patient to open and close the hand, \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\772.0\D\1.1\2.1\smooth \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\773.0\D\1.1\2.1\painless \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\774.0\D\1.1\2.1\and complete movement of the thumb virtually excludes [3w] tenosynovitis . \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\775.0\D\1.14\2.1\ Clearly you don't have full motion of the thumb, \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\776.0\D\1.14\2.1\so, local tenderness over the distal portion of the radial styloid,  so you definitely have that,  \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\777.0\D\1.1\2.1\pain is aggravated by resisting thumb extension . \2.0\\\\R\
395.0\778.0\D\1.14\2.4\ So no doubt if you try to move your thumb\2.0\\\\R\
396.0\779.0\P\1.14\3.1\hm\2.0\\\\R\
397.0\780.0\D\1.14\11.0\against that, that hurts.  Yeah.  \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\781.0\D\1.1\2.1\ Pain is aggravated by passively stretching of the thumb tendons over the radial styloid.  \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\782.0\D\1.1\2.1\ Finkelstein maneuver, \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\783.0\D\1.1\3.2\that's, okay, yeah, \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\784.0\D\3.1\2.121\so I'm not gonna do this, \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\785.0\D\1.14\2.2\cuz I know it's gonna hurt you, \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\786.0\D\1.14\2.4\but you know, pushing down like that to stretch that, kind of like that motion.  That would hurt you, \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\787.0\D\1.14\2.2\I know it would. \2.0\\\\R\
397.0\788.0\D\1.12\2.12\ So anyway, I think we pretty much established the\2.0\\\\R\
398.0\789.0\P\1.12\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
399.0\790.0\D\1.12\11.0\Diagnosis. \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\791.0\D\1.11\3.2\ You, let's see here, \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\792.0\D\1.11\2.1\ pain relief can be accomplished with ice applications to the radial styloid fifteen minutes every four to six hours. \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\793.0\D\1.11\2.1\ Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory,  \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\794.0\D\6.0\5.1\so the Ibuprofen, \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\795.0\D\6.0\5.1\the Motrin you're taking may be helpful with symptoms of recent onset \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\796.0\D\6.0\5.1\and not severe.  \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\797.0\D\1.11\2.1\ Thumb movement should be restricted by buddytaping the base of the thumb to the first finger . \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\798.0\D\8.0\5.1\ So I guess what they're saying is we should try to immobilize it like this, \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\799.0\D\8.0\5.1\so that you can't move the thumb without moving that index finger.  \2.0\\\\R\
399.0\800.0\D\8.0\5.1\Um, I guess that would be better than an ace bandage over the entire wrist.\2.0\\\\R\
400.0\801.0\P\8.0\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
401.0\802.0\D\1.18\82.0\Now if your pain, \2.0\\\\R\
401.0\803.0\D\1.14\2.14\your pain has been going on for a month.  \2.0\\\\R\
401.0\804.0\D\6.0\2.1\If these measures don't work, then actually they say here that the next step is to inject steroids right into that area.  \2.0\\\\R\
401.0\805.0\D\6.0\2.1\And I don't have any experience with that. \2.0\\\\R\
401.0\806.0\D\6.0\2.121\ I'll have to have a rheumatologist help us\2.0\\\\R\
402.0\807.0\P\6.0\3.1\Okay.\2.0\\\\R\
403.0\808.0\D\6.0\11.0\Probably with that. \2.0\\\\R\
