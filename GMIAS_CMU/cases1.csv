20.0\37.0\D\1.14\1.11\ So tell me - first tell me what's bothering you with the hemorrhoids, \\2.0\\\\P\
20.0\38.0\D\1.14\2.1\just so I can jot it down \\2.0\\\\P\
20.0\39.0\D\1.14\6.3\and certainly get you [a referral] for it.\\2.0\\\\R\
21.0\40.0\P\1.14\2.1\It's not, it's not bleeding in the toilet, \\2.0\\\\P\

38.0\65.0\D\6.0\2.66\Good.\\2.0\\\\P\

40.0\68.0\D\6.0\2.1\Either one.\\2.0\\\\P\
41.0\69.0\P\6.0\3.1\OK\\2.0\\\\P\
42.0\70.0\D\6.0\2.1\They're not that magical, you know, \\2.0\\\\P\
42.0\71.0\D\6.0\2.1\they're supposed to ease off the irritation a bit. \\2.0\\\\I\
42.0\72.0\D\6.0\2.1\ Whichever you prefer - \\2.0\\\\P\
42.0\73.0\D\6.0\2.1\I don't have a strong preference.\\2.0\\\\P\
43.0\74.0\P\6.0\2.1\Sometimes they can be real itchy.\\2.0\\\\P\
44.0\75.0\D\6.0\3.6\Yeah.  \\2.0\\\\P\
44.0\76.0\D\8.0\5.1\Oh, The other thing people do sometimes that can make it less irritated, is to sit in the warm water\\2.0\\\\R\
45.0\77.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm\\2.0\\\\R\
46.0\78.0\D\8.0\5.1\either an actual bathtub \\2.0\\\\R\
46.0\79.0\D\8.0\5.1\or in a little plastic tub they call a sitz bath \\2.0\\\\R\
46.0\80.0\D\8.0\2.1\that you can sort of put warm water in \\2.0\\\\R\
46.0\81.0\D\8.0\2.1\and put in the bottom of a tub or a chair.\\2.0\\\\R\
47.0\82.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm\\2.0\\\\R\
48.0\83.0\D\8.0\2.1\It's smaller, \\2.0\\\\R\
48.0\84.0\D\8.0\2.1\so it kind of concentrates. \\2.0\\\\R\
48.0\85.0\D\8.0\2.1\ It's not so hot that it's painful, \\2.0\\\\R\
48.0\86.0\D\8.0\2.1\but warm.\\2.0\\\\R\2.0
49.0\87.0\P\8.0\1.12\Do you have one?\\2.0\\\\P\

51.0\90.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm\\2.0\\\\I\
52.0\91.0\D\8.0\2.2\although I don't know if they would have it here. \\2.0\\\\I\
52.0\92.0\D\8.0\2.1\ It's not a prescription thing,\\2.0\\\\I\
53.0\93.0\P\8.0\3.1\Oh OK\\2.0\\\\I\
54.0\94.0\D\8.0\2.1\it's just something you would have to buy if you want to. \\2.0\\\\I\
54.0\95.0\D\8.0\2.2\ I don't know - \\2.0\\\\I\

62.0\107.0\D\8.0\5.4\just ask for it \\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\108.0\D\8.0\2.1\and they sell it to you. \\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\109.0\D\8.0\2.1\ It's not the - I don't think I don't think  insurances will pay for it. \\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\110.0\D\8.0\2.1\Um I've never known them to pay for it. \\2.0\\\\I\
62.0\111.0\D\8.0\2.1\Um  It's just sort of a plastic thing that's\\2.0\\\\I\

112.0\189.0\D\3.0\2.1\ So I can understand how much they did, \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\190.0\D\3.0\2.1\what they didn't do, \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\191.0\D\1.11\2.1\and then have a better sense of what what next steps are, \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\192.0\D\8.0\2.1\other than wearing a brace \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\193.0\D\81.0\2.1\and sort of [2w].  \\1.0\\\\P\
112.0\194.0\D\1.14\2.1\A lot of times it's just time.\\1.0\\\\P\

126.0\213.0\D\1.14\2.1\Well you're probably leaning over a little bit.\\1.0\\\\P\
127.0\214.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah.\\1.0\\\\P\
128.0\215.0\D\1.14\2.1\And that puts more stress on the muscles next to the spine, \\1.0\\\\P\
128.0\216.0\D\1.14\2.1\which is usually where the pain is coming from \\1.0\\\\P\
128.0\217.0\D\1.14\2.1\[the muscles 3w]\\1.0\\\\P\
129.0\218.0\P\1.14\2.1\And my son brought something to my attention yesterday, \\1.0\\\\P\
129.0\219.0\P\1.14\2.11\when I'm driving, I'm driving up.  \\1.0\\\\P\
129.0\220.0\P\1.14\2.1\And he said, "Mama, why don't you try\\1.0\\\\P\
130.0\221.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
131.0\222.0\P\1.14\11.0\sitting back\\1.0\\\\P\
132.0\223.0\D\1.14\3.1\yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
133.0\224.0\P\1.14\11.0\you know, \\1.0\\\\P\
133.0\225.0\P\1.14\2.1\and relax.\\1.0\\\\P\
134.0\226.0\D\1.14\3.1\Yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
135.0\227.0\P\1.14\2.1\But I found myself sitting up like this.\\1.0\\\\P\
136.0\228.0\D\1.14\2.1\Many people put more stress on the muscles of their back than we were they were designed for. \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\229.0\D\1.14\2.1\ The spine holds weight in a way that's most effortless when your back is fairly straight. \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\230.0\D\1.14\2.1\ I mean it has its own curvature, \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\231-1\D\1.14\2.1\but you know many people you know \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\232.0\D\1.14\2.63\[chuckles] \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\231-2\D\1.14\2.1\[crosstalk 2w] these positions, \\1.0\\\\I\
136.0\233.0\D\1.14\2.1\and that always puts more stress on the muscles on the sides.\\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\234.0\P\1.14\81.0\[Crosstalk 5w]. \\1.0\\\\I\
137.0\235.0\P\1.14\2.1\ My mother suffered from that.\\1.0\\\\P\
138.0\236.0\D\1.14\2.1\Well I used to get a lot of back pain,\\1.0\\\\P\
139.0\237.0\P\1.14\3.1\Yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
140.0\238.0\D\8.0\2.11\and then I started doing yoga, \\1.0\\\\P\
140.0\239.0\D\8.0\2.1\which made me just more aware of posture,\\1.0\\\\P\
141.0\240.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\241.0\D\8.0\2.1\and it went away.  \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\242.0\D\8.0\2.1\You know, for years I would get backaches, \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\243.0\D\8.0\2.1\and then just I mean I'm still not so perfect in the way I sit \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\244.0\D\8.0\2.1\and the way I carry myself, \\1.0\\\\P\
142.0\245.0\D\8.0\2.1\but um awareness of posture and being careful about it is just sort of the thing your son had mentioned to you.\\1.0\\\\P\
143.0\246.0\P\8.0\3.1\Yeah\\1.0\\\\P\
144.0\247.0\D\8.0\2.1\It's not I mean it's not magic - \\1.0\\\\I\
144.0\248.0\D\8.0\2.1\it doesn't work the next day, \\1.0\\\\I\
144.0\249.0\D\8.0\2.1\but over - you know, I went from years of having backaches to never having them at all.\\1.0\\\\P\
145.0\250.0\P\8.0\3.1\Mhm\\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\251.0\D\8.0\3.2\You know, but \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\252.0\D\8.0\2.63\[chuckles] \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\253.0\D\8.0\2.1\it wasn't a fast event - \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\254.0\D\8.0\2.1\it was you know a gradual event. \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\255.0\D\1.14\2.1\ And in the meantime, this is hurting more, \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\256.0\D\1.14\5.1\and having having other things to help I think makes makes good sense.  \\1.0\\\\P\
146.0\257.0\D\1.14\2.12\But what But I'm betting you know when you're vacuuming, you're tilted,\\1.0\\\\R\

151.0\262.0\P\1.14\3.1\Right\\1.0\\\\P\
152.0\263.0\D\1.14\2.1\or you're not used to standing straight up, \\1.0\\\\P\
152.0\264.0\D\1.14\2.1\so you tilt it \\1.0\\\\R\
152.0\265.0\D\1.14\2.1\and putting more stress on it.\\1.0\\\\R\
153.0\266.0\P\1.14\81.0\[8w] bent over.\\1.0\\\\P\
154.0\267.0\D\1.14\3.6\Yeah. \\1.0\\\\P\

155.0\272.0\P\1.14\81.0\[3w] \\1.0\\\\P\
155.0\273.0\P\1.14\83.0\[what do you mean] sitting way up like that, you know? \\1.0\\\\P\

159.0\283.0\P\1.14\2.1\I said, "Okay," \\1.0\\\\P\
159.0\284.0\P\1.14\2.11\so I let the seat back a little bit, \\1.0\\\\P\
159.0\285.0\P\1.14\2.1\and then just [2w] that lets me relax.\\1.0\\\\P\

198.0\355.0\D\1.13\2.1\Sometimes when you've been off medicine, of course, there's been a little of virus, \\5.0\\\\P\
198.0\356.0\D\1.13\2.1\and the time that we stopped it years ago was then you were not so consistent using the medicine, \\5.0\\\\P\
198.0\357.0\D\1.13\2.1\so the virus level was going up.\\5.0\\\\P\
199.0\358.0\P\1.13\3.1\[Right]\\5.0\\\\P\

211.0\375.0\P\1.15\81.0\[5w]\\6.0\\\\P\
212.0\376.0\D\1.15\2.1\Yeah. So they were fine. \\6.0\\\\P\

212.0\382.0\D\3.0\2.1\which is a little earlier than we would do just in terms of HIV \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\381-2\D\1.14\2.1\was because you're having all this leg trouble and whatnot. \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\383.0\D\1.14\2.51\ I didn't want to just sort of let it go for months without knowing that that had been dealt with \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\384.0\D\1.14\2.1\and that was okay.  \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\385.0\D\1.14\2.1\So now that's gone \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\386.0\D\1.14\2.1\and this is - \\1.0\\\\P\
212.0\387.0\D\1.14\2.1\so there's this other issue going on.  \\1.0\\\\P\
