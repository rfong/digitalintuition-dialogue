65.0\98.0\D\2.4\3.1\All right.\2.0\4.0\\\\P\
66.0\99.0\P\2.4\2.4\Cause it's amazing \3.0\4.0\\\\P\

67.0\101.0\D\4.0\1.11\And have you gotten any more feed back on us coming to your church?\14.0\S\\\\\
68.0\102.0\P\4.0\2.1\Yeah, people are saying that they really, really enjoyed it\10.0\S\\\\\
69.0\103.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mmm\1.0\S\\\\\
70.0\104.0\P\4.0\2.12\and they hope that we do that again like real soon \11.0\S\\\\\
70.0\105.0\P\4.0\2.51\and I said we probably will.\6.0\S\\\\\
71.0\106.0\D\4.0\3.6\Ok. \1.0\S\\\\\
71.0\107.0\D\4.0\2.1\Well we can.\3.0\S\\\\\
72.0\108.0\P\4.0\5.1\And something a little more educative.  \6.0\S\\\\\
72.0\109.0\P\4.0\2.4\There wasn't a lot of education going on,\8.0\S\\\\\
73.0\110.0\D\4.0\3.1\Mmm\1.0\S\\\\\
74.0\111.0\P\4.0\2.1\it's basically the film \4.0\S\\\\\
74.0\112.0\P\4.0\2.1\and their own questions.\4.0\S\\\\\
75.0\113.0\D\4.0\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\S\\\\\
76.0\114.0\P\4.0\2.51\So I said, maybe next time  we will go a little more indepth.\13.0\S\\\\\
77.0\115.0\D\4.0\2.1\Well, the feedback that I got was that they had been to all three churches \15.0\S\\\\\
77.0\116.0\D\4.0\2.1\and so they really liked the interaction that they had at your church\13.0\S\\\\\
78.0\117.0\P\4.0\3.1\Oh, ok\2.0\S\\\\\
79.0\118.0\D\4.0\2.1\because number one, you did have a membership, right,\9.0\S\\\\\
80.0\119.0\P\4.0\3.1\Ok\1.0\S\\\\\
81.0\120.0\D\4.0\2.1\everybody that was basically in the church that didn't go [1w] came.\12.0\S\\\\\
82.0\121.0\P\4.0\3.1\Ok\1.0\S\\\\\
83.0\122.0\D\4.0\2.4\So that was good. \4.0\S\\\\\
83.0\123.0\D\4.0\2.1\ They also thought it was good just not to have a format, but a panel.\15.0\S\\\\\
84.0\124.0\P\4.0\3.1\Yeah\1.0\S\\\\\
85.0\125.0\D\4.0\2.1\We didn't have that, \4.0\S\\\\\
85.0\126.0\D\4.0\2.4\that was good.\3.0\S\\\\\
86.0\127.0\P\4.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\S\\\\\
87.0\128.0\D\4.0\3.6\Ok. \1.0\S\\\\\
87.0\129.0\D\4.0\2.1\And that they learned a lot from the panels.\9.0\S\\\\\
88.0\130.0\P\4.0\3.1\Ok\1.0\S\\\\\
89.0\131.0\D\4.0\2.1\And then you also had two of the ministers, it might have been more, \14.0\S\\\\\
89.0\132.0\D\4.0\2.11\but I'm looking at my other page in [name of place?]\11.0\S\\\\\
90.0\133.0\P\4.0\3.1\Ok\1.0\S\\\\\
91.0\134.0\D\4.0\3.2\that were there, ok\4.0\S\\\\\
92.0\135.0\P\4.0\2.13\Right\1.0\S\\\\\
93.0\136.0\D\4.0\2.1\but you don't usually have someone stay. \7.0\S\\\\\
93.0\137.0\D\4.0\2.1\ They stayed the entire time.\5.0\S\\\\\
94.0\138.0\P\4.0\3.1\Yeah, yeah.\2.0\S\\\\\
95.0\139.0\D\4.0\3.6\Okay, \1.0\S\\\\\
95.0\140.0\D\4.0\2.4\so it shows a commitment,\5.0\S\\\\\
96.0\141.0\P\4.0\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\S\\\\\
97.0\142.0\D\4.0\5.1\so I think you really need to work on that ministry. \11.0\S\\\\\
97.0\143.0\D\4.0\81.0\[crosstalk 3w]\2.0\S\\\\\
98.0\144.0\P\4.0\2.2\Yeah, I know. \3.0\S\\\\\
98.0\145.0\P\4.0\2.1\She mentioned that she was like maybe we could have an HIV ministry, \13.0\S\\\\\
98.0\146.0\P\4.0\2.1\but it was so brief and fleeting \7.0\S\\\\\
98.0\147.0\P\4.0\2.1\she has so many things to do\7.0\S\\\\\
99.0\148.0\D\4.0\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\S\\\\\
100.0\149.0\P\4.0\2.2\that I know that I would have to, have to keep doing it.  \13.0\S\\\\\
100.0\150.0\P\4.0\2.1\They have a woman's department now,\6.0\S\\\\\
101.0\151.0\D\4.0\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\S\\\\\
102.0\152.0\P\4.0\82.0\so we were.  \3.0\S\\\\\
102.0\153.0\P\4.0\2.51\I named myself I nominated myself as secretary, \8.0\S\\\\\
102.0\154.0\P\4.0\2.11\so I'm like let's do this, let's do that.\9.0\S\\\\\
103.0\155.0\D\4.0\5.1\You can piggyback with the women.\6.0\S\\\\\
104.0\156.0\P\4.0\2.4\Now I get a chance to put in my input.\10.0\S\\\\\
105.0\157.0\D\4.0\2.13\Right, \1.0\S\\\\\
105.0\158.0\D\4.0\5.1\but even with the woman's ministry, figure even if you don't want to have  separate HIV, you could put it in do that,\23.0\S\\\\\
106.0\159.0\P\4.0\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\S\\\\\
107.0\160.0\D\4.0\11.0\they don't do anything, any um any programs, you can always have an HIV piece.\15.0\S\\\\\
108.0\161.0\P\4.0\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\S\\\\\
109.0\162.0\D\4.0\2.4\So that would be good.\5.0\S\\\\\
110.0\163.0\P\4.0\2.51\I was thinking about doing that for the chaplaincy.\9.0\S\\\\\
111.0\164.0\D\4.0\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\S\\\\\
111.0\165.0\D\4.0\3.6\All right\2.0\S\\\\\

144.0\221.0\P\5.115\11.0\without fail, \2.0\8.0\\\\P\
144.0\222.0\P\5.115\2.11\or twice a day I'm struggling with doing that,\9.0\8.0\\\\P\
145.0\223.0\D\5.115\3.1\mmm\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
146.0\224.0\P\5.115\11.0\with staying adherent to that.\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
147.0\225.0\D\5.115\3.2\Okay, because\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
148.0\226.0\P\5.115\2.4\I'm really struggling.\3.0\8.0\\\\P\
149.0\227.0\D\5.115\3.6\All right, \2.0\8.0\\\\P\
149.0\228.0\D\5.1\1.121\because again, your medicines are twice a day, right?\9.0\8.0\\\\P\
150.0\229.0\P\5.1\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
151.0\230.0\D\5.1\3.2\The Kaletra is  um so you are saying, \8.0\8.0\\\\P\
151.0\231.0\D\5.11\1.121\you are telling me that you are missing the Kaletra?\10.0\8.0\\\\P\
152.0\232.0\P\5.11\2.11\Yeah,\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
153.0\233.0\D\5.11\3.1\All right\2.0\8.0\\\\P\
154.0\234.0\P\5.1\2.1\twice a day.\3.0\8.0\\\\P\
155.0\235.0\D\1.13\2.1\So, [Name of patient], look, you have been undetectable all along, ok. \12.0\8.0\\\\P\
155.0\236.0\D\5.115\1.11\Have you been missing that second Kaletra?\7.0\8.0\\\\P\
156.0\237.0\P\5.115\2.11\Most of the time\4.0\8.0\\\\P\
157.0\238.0\D\5.115\1.122\Most of the time? \4.0\8.0\\\\P\
157.0\239.0\D\1.13\1.121\ Even when these say undetectable?\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
158.0\240.0\P\5.115\2.11\Most of the time, \4.0\8.0\\\\P\
158.0\241.0\P\5.115\2.11\ I miss it uh so often it's like ridiculous.\9.0\8.0\\\\P\
159.0\242.0\D\5.115\3.2\All right, so wh\4.0\8.0\\\\P\
160.0\243.0\P\5.12\2.11\Um But I take it, I definitely would take it once a day \13.0\8.0\\\\P\
160.0\244.0\P\5.12\2.11\and I take all of the meds at least once a day.\12.0\8.0\\\\P\
161.0\245.0\D\5.12\3.1\Okay.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
162.0\246.0\P\5.115\2.11\But that second dose of it, the Kaletra is the one that I will usually miss.  \16.0\8.0\\\\P\
162.0\247.0\P\5.12\2.11\The others I wont.  \4.0\8.0\\\\P\
162.0\248.0\P\5.115\3.2\But I uh\3.0\8.0\\\\P\
163.0\249.0\D\5.115\2.1\But the others are only once a day\8.0\8.0\\\\P\
164.0\250.0\P\5.115\2.13\Yes\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
165.0\251.0\D\1.13\2.61\and I'm just worried you are going to get resistant.  \10.0\8.0\\\\P\
165.0\252.0\D\1.13\2.1\Okay, these look good. \4.0\9.0\TEST RES\4.22\D\P\
165.0\253.0\D\1.13\2.1\ T cell count over 700 \5.0\9.0\\\\P\
165.0\254.0\D\1.13\2.66\and the undetectable, that's good, \5.0\9.0\\\\P\5.0
165.0\255.0\D\5.32\2.121\but I think if we know that you are only going to be taking it once a day, we need to maybe switch you to a once a day regimen.\30.0\8.0\ADHERENCE\\\R\
166.0\256.0\P\5.32\1.11\Like a whole [new list] of medication\7.0\8.0\\\\R\
167.0\257.0\D\5.32\3.1\Uhhum\1.0\8.0\\\\R\
168.0\258.0\P\5.32\1.11\of just the same medicine once a day?\8.0\8.0\\\\R\
169.0\259.0\D\5.32\2.1\Well, Kaletra, um that's the only one that's twice a day \11.0\8.0\\\\P\
169.0\260.0\D\5.32\2.2\and I don't think there is any data saying that we could take that once a day.\17.0\8.0\\\\I\
170.0\261.0\P\5.32\3.1\Okay.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
171.0\262.0\D\5.32\2.121\So that would be one that we would have to change.  \11.0\8.0\\\\R\
171.0\263.0\D\5.32\6.2\I would double check with [that] uh and see. \9.0\8.0\\\\R\
171.0\264.0\D\5.1\2.12\ But Uh, it's en it's encouraging on one point that you have missed some dosages \15.0\8.0\\\\P\
171.0\265.0\D\5.1\2.12\and you have been undetectable,\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
172.0\266.0\P\5.1\3.1\Yeah\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
173.0\267.0\D\5.32\2.4\um but I don't, I don't want us to run into trouble later.  \13.0\8.0\\\\P\
173.0\268.0\D\5.32\81.0\And I wanna [4w  crosstalk]\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
174.0\269.0\P\5.1\2.11\I've been taking it for years, like three years now \10.0\8.0\\\\P\
174.0\270.0\P\5.1\2.12\and it's pretty much all the time.\7.0\8.0\\\\P\
175.0\271.0\D\5.32\2.1\Yeah, the one thing is in your favor though, the Kaletra, they have been talking about trying to do it as like monotherapy, \23.0\8.0\\\\I\
175.0\272.0\D\5.32\2.4\but we are nowhere near just only taking Kaletra.\9.0\8.0\\\\I\
176.0\273.0\P\5.32\2.13\Right\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
177.0\274.0\D\5.32\2.1\But it maybe that potent, \5.0\8.0\\\\I\
177.0\275.0\D\5.32\2.2\but we don't have any information like that that's ready for primetime.\12.0\8.0\\\\I\
178.0\276.0\P\5.32\3.6\All right, \2.0\8.0\\\\I\
178.0\277.0\P\5.1\2.11\you know with some medicines I was taking, I failed the once a day regimen once before. \17.0\8.0\\\\P\
178.0\278.0\P\5.1\2.2\I think it was Viramune.\5.0\8.0\\\\P\
179.0\279.0\D\5.1\3.6\Okay.  \1.0\8.0\\\\P\
179.0\280.0\D\81.0\81.0\[crosstalk 2w]\2.0\8.0\\\\P\

181.0\283.0\D\5.1\2.1\No, that was that's uh a twoday regimen, \8.0\8.0\\\\P\
181.0\284.0\D\5.1\1.11\but anyway, just, what is it about the second dose?\10.0\8.0\\\\P\
182.0\285.0\P\5.1\1.11\You know what it is? \5.0\8.0\\\\P\
182.0\286.0\P\6.0\2.11\ I take so many things like I take vitamins \9.0\8.0\\\\P\

189.0\300.0\D\5.1\2.13\It's only two pills, so [1w]\6.0\8.0\\\\P\

190.0\302.0\P\5.1\2.1\ It's uh Vi Videx, Viread, one is in the morning with the Kaletra \13.0\8.0\\\\P\
