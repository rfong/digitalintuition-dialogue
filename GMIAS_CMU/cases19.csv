53.0\74.0\P\6.0\2.11\Excuse me - before I eat. \\6.0\\\\P\
53.0\75.0\P\6.0\2.11\ And then if I tired, I gotta take more, like that sliding scale thing.\\6.0\\\\P\
54.0\76.0\D\6.0\2.13\Right, \\6.0\\\\P\
54.0\77.0\D\6.0\1.121\so they gave you sliding scale?\\6.0\\\\P\
55.0\78.0\P\6.0\2.13\Yeah.\\6.0\\\\P\
56.0\79.0\D\6.0\1.12\Did you understand how that works?\\6.0\\\\P\
57.0\80.0\P\6.0\2.1\Sometimes.\\6.0\\\\P\
58.0\81.0\D\6.0\2.4\It's hard to follow.  \\6.0\\\\P\
58.0\82.0\D\6.0\2.1\So you have to check your blood sugar.  \\6.0\\\\P\
58.0\83.0\D\6.0\1.12\And then did they give you a list of your blood sugars, what it is \\6.0\\\\P\
58.0\84.0\D\6.0\1.12\and how much more insulin you give yourself?\\6.0\\\\P\
59.0\85.0\P\6.0\2.4\I should probably get another chart, \\6.0\\\\P\
59.0\86.0\P\6.0\2.1\because the way how they gave me it's like, if it's 300, take four units\\6.0\\\\P\
60.0\87.0\D\6.0\3.1\Uh huh.\\6.0\\\\P\
61.0\88.0\P\6.0\2.1\And if it's 400, take six units \\6.0\\\\P\
61.0\89.0\P\6.0\2.1\and and um try it again.  \\6.0\\\\P\
61.0\90.0\P\6.0\2.1\If it's still high, call the doctor.\\6.0\\\\P\
62.0\91.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay. \\6.0\\\\P\
62.0\92.0\D\6.0\1.12\So you know what that is, you have the sliding scale at home?\\6.0\\\\P\
63.0\93.0\P\6.0\2.1\Um It should be right on there.\\6.0\\\\P\
64.0\94.0\D\6.0\2.1\Well it's on this paper, \\6.0\\\\P\
64.0\95.0\D\6.0\1.12\but do you know what it is?\\6.0\\\\P\
65.0\96.0\P\6.0\2.2\No.\\6.0\\\\P\
66.0\97.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay, \\6.0\\\\P\
66.0\98.0\D\6.0\2.1\cuz it says, "If your blood sugar is way over 300 but less than 400, give yourself four units of the insulin.\\6.0\\\\P\
67.0\99.0\P\6.0\2.13\Right.\\6.0\\\\P\
68.0\100.0\D\6.0\2.1\"If your blood sugar's greater than 400, give yourself six units, and then call."\\6.0\\\\P\
69.0\101.0\P\6.0\2.13\Right.\\6.0\\\\P\
70.0\102.0\D\6.0\1.121\So you should be - if you're under 300, you don't need to give yourself any additional insulin, right?\\6.0\\\\P\
71.0\103.0\P\6.0\2.1\Just the two units.\\6.0\\\\P\
72.0\104.0\D\6.0\2.131\Just the two units. \\6.0\\\\P\
72.0\105.0\D\6.0\5.4\ If it's above 300, though, you need to give yourself four more units. \\6.0\\\\P\
72.0\106.0\D\6.0\5.4\ If it's above 400, you need to give yourself six units.\\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\107.0\P\6.0\3.6\Okay. \\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\108.0\P\6.0\1.12\ But what if it's 150 \\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\109.0\P\6.0\1.12\or 130 \\6.0\\\\P\
73.0\110.0\P\6.0\1.12\or 120?\\6.0\\\\P\
74.0\111.0\D\6.0\1.12\Is that more than 300 \\6.0\\\\P\
74.0\112.0\D\6.0\1.12\or less than 300?\\6.0\\\\P\
75.0\113.0\P\6.0\2.1\Less.\\6.0\\\\P\
76.0\114.0\D\6.0\2.131\Less.  \\6.0\\\\P\
76.0\115.0\D\6.0\1.11\So what do you think you should do?\\6.0\\\\P\
77.0\116.0\P\6.0\1.12\Should I still take the two units?\\6.0\\\\P\
78.0\117.0\D\6.0\2.13\Yes.\\6.0\\\\P\
79.0\118.0\P\6.0\3.6\Okay.\\6.0\\\\P\
80.0\119.0\D\6.0\2.131\Yes.\\6.0\\\\P\

86.0\126.0\P\1.16\2.2\No juice.  \\6.0\\\\P\
86.0\127.0\P\1.16\2.11\[I'm on a diet].\\6.0\\\\P\
87.0\128.0\D\1.16\1.12\Does that help you with your diet?\\6.0\\\\P\
