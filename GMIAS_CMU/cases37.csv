20.0\30.0\D\2.9\3.1\mhm\1.0\\\\P\
21.0\31.0\P\2.9\2.1\and because of that, the hospital is having issue with my Medicaid. \1.0\\\\P\
21.0\32.0\P\2.9\2.11\ So, um went there, when I spoke to the director\1.0\\\\P\
22.0\33.0\D\2.9\3.1\yeah\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\34.0\P\2.9\2.1\and he said that if I don't want to stay with Infinity, I need to um disenroll, \1.0\\\\P\
23.0\35.0\P\2.9\2.5\which I want to do.  I want to disenroll from Infinity, \1.0\\\\P\
23.0\36.0\P\2.9\2.1\because they kind of forced this up on Medicaid \1.0\\\\P\
23.0\37.0\P\2.9\2.1\and now it is causing problems, \1.0\\\\P\
23.0\38.0\P\5.1\2.1\um the medications not working for me anymore.\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\39.0\D\5.1\1.11\What do you mean the medications not working?\1.0\\\\P\
25.0\40.0\P\5.1\2.1\that They discontinued the Truvada \1.0\\\\P\
25.0\41.0\P\5.1\2.1\and Sustiva\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\42.0\D\5.1\1.12\Who did?\1.0\\\\P\
27.0\43.0\P\5.1\2.11\Um, I came last week \1.0\\\\P\
27.0\44.0\P\5.1\2.1\and they told me that it was discontinued \1.0\\\\P\
27.0\45.0\P\5.1\2.1\because it's no longer working for me.  \1.0\\\\P\
27.0\46.0\P\5.1\82.1\And probably\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\47.0\D\5.1\5.4\Wait, \1.0\\\\P\
28.0\48.0\D\5.1\2.2\I am completely confused, \1.0\\\\P\
28.0\49.0\D\3.0\1.12\who did you see last week?\1.0\\\\P\
29.0\50.0\P\3.0\2.1\I saw the Filipino lady that usually gives the shots and stuff.\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\51.0\D\3.0\5.4\Wait a minute. .\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\52.0\P\3.0\2.14\Cause you remember, I took the blood work to see if I had cause of this symptoms for the medication.\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\53.0\D\3.0\3.6\Right, exactly. \1.0\\\\P\
32.0\54.0\D\3.0\1.121\ Wait, she said she got that report back already?\1.0\\\\P\
33.0\55.0\P\3.0\2.13\I think so, yeah.\1.0\\\\P\
34.0\56.0\D\3.0\5.4\Hang on a second. \1.0\\\\P\
34.0\57.0\D\3.0\2.121\ Let me see what I wrote here first.\1.0\\\\P\
35.0\58.0\P\5.1\2.68\I wasn't happy about it.\1.0\\\\P\
36.0\59.0\D\5.1\1.121\10/2/06 we switch you to Atripla, right?\1.0\\\\P\
37.0\60.0\P\5.1\2.13\mhm\1.0\\\\P\
38.0\61.0\D\5.1\2.1\that was the Sustiva \1.0\\\\P\
38.0\62.0\D\5.1\2.1\and Truvada, \1.0\\\\P\
38.0\63.0\D\5.1\2.1\just last month\1.0\\\\P\
39.0\64.0\P\5.1\3.1\right\1.0\\\\P\
40.0\65.0\D\5.1\2.1\I saw you \1.0\\\\P\
40.0\66.0\D\5.1\1.121\and we switched you over to Atripla, all right?\1.0\\\\P\
41.0\67.0\P\5.14\1.121\Which is the one a day?\1.0\\\\P\
42.0\68.0\D\5.14\2.13\That's correct.\1.0\\\\P\
43.0\69.0\P\5.14\3.1\ok\1.0\\\\P\
44.0\70.0\D\5.14\2.1\That is correct.  \1.0\\\\P\
44.0\71.0\D\1.13\2.1\Then I drew your blood at that time. \1.0\\\\P\
44.0\72.0\D\1.13\2.1\ Your T cells actually went up a little bit. \1.0\\\\P\
44.0\73.0\D\1.13\2.1\ They were 286, from 267 \1.0\\\\P\
44.0\74.0\D\1.13\2.1\and an increase in your percentage, \1.0\\\\P\
44.0\75.0\D\1.13\1.121\which was the active cells that are working, right?\1.0\\\\P\
45.0\76.0\P\1.13\2.13\Yeah.\1.0\\\\P\
46.0\77.0\D\1.13\2.1\And your viral load, you're right, did not come down very much, \1.0\\\\P\
46.0\78.0\D\1.13\2.11\so what I wrote on 11/02, \1.0\\\\P\
46.0\79.0\D\1.13\1.121\it's always good to write notes, right?\1.0\\\\P\
47.0\80.0\P\1.13\2.13\Yes.\1.0\\\\P\
48.0\81.0\D\1.13\82.0\um, your serology, \1.0\\\\P\
48.0\82.0\D\1.13\1.12\where is this genotype that we are talking about?\1.0\\\\P\
49.0\83.0\P\1.13\2.2\I don't know, \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\84.0\P\5.1\2.1\I just know that she said that they discontinued the medication \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\85.0\P\5.1\82.0\because, they couldn't, \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\86.0\P\3.0\82.0\like I went to, \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\87.0\P\3.0\2.1\'cause you weren't here, \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\88.0\P\3.3\2.1\to get a refill of the medications \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\89.0\P\3.3\11.0\because I had no money \1.0\\\\P\
49.0\90.0\P\3.0\82.1\and she said\1.0\\\\P\
50.0\91.0\D\3.0\5.4\Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  \1.0\\\\P\
50.0\92.0\D\3.0\2.1\This is a big mistake.  \1.0\\\\P\
50.0\93.0\D\3.0\2.1\This is a misunderstanding.\1.0\\\\P\
51.0\94.0\P\3.0\3.1\Oh.\1.0\\\\P\
52.0\95.0\D\3.0\2.1\This is a misunderstanding. \1.0\\\\P\
52.0\96.0\D\5.1\2.12\ I think what happened is we had switched you over to Atripla\1.0\\\\P\
53.0\97.0\P\5.1\3.6\ohhh \1.0\\\\P\
53.0\98.0\P\5.1\82.1\that's why\1.0\\\\P\
54.0\99.0\D\5.1\2.1\which is a combination of Sustiva, \1.0\\\\P\
54.0\100.0\D\5.1\2.1\tenofovir, \1.0\\\\P\
54.0\101.0\D\5.1\2.1\and FTC. \1.0\\\\P\
54.0\102.0\D\5.1\2.1\ So when you called asking for Sustiva and Truvada\1.0\\\\P\
55.0\103.0\P\5.1\3.1\I see\1.0\\\\P\
56.0\104.0\D\5.1\2.1\she said that's been disconnected, discontinued\1.0\\\\P\
57.0\105.0\P\5.1\3.6\ohh oh \1.0\\\\P\
57.0\106.0\P\5.1\81.0\[2w]\1.0\\\\P\
58.0\107.0\D\5.1\2.1\You're on Atripla. \1.0\\\\P\
58.0\108.0\D\5.1\5.1\ You should be on medicine!\1.0\\\\P\
59.0\109.0\P\5.1\2.2\I know, \1.0\\\\P\
59.0\110.0\P\5.1\2.1\but they didn't understand then, then.  \1.0\\\\P\
59.0\111.0\P\5.1\2.1\They, they should have prescribed me that.  \1.0\\\\P\
59.0\112.0\P\5.1\2.1\They didn't understand.\1.0\\\\P\
60.0\113.0\D\3.0\5.4\If anyone ever tells you something that I haven't told you\1.0\\\\P\
61.0\114.0\P\3.0\3.1\Right\1.0\\\\P\
62.0\115.0\D\3.0\11.0\call me right away\1.0\\\\P\
63.0\116.0\P\3.0\3.1\alright alright.\1.0\\\\P\
64.0\117.0\D\5.1\5.4\You need to be on this medicine.\1.0\\\\P\
65.0\118.0\P\5.1\3.6\I do \1.0\\\\P\
65.0\119.0\P\5.11\2.11\because I haven't taken it in almost a week now.\1.0\\\\P\
66.0\120.0\D\5.11\7.0\Oh god, I'm gonna kill you. \1.0\\\\P\
66.0\121.0\D\5.11\3.2\ Okay. \1.0\\\\E\
66.0\122.0\D\5.11\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\\\\E\
67.0\123.0\P\5.1\2.2\I mean, I didn't really know what was going on.\1.0\\\\P\
68.0\124.0\D\5.1\3.6\No, no, no.  \1.0\\\\P\
68.0\125.0\D\5.1\2.1\That was bad information.  \1.0\\\\P\
68.0\126.0\D\5.1\2.1\You shouldn't have gotten that information. \1.0\\\\P\
68.0\127.0\D\5.1\2.44\ I apologize for that.\1.0\\\\E\
69.0\128.0\P\5.1\2.68\oh god!\1.0\\\\E\
70.0\129.0\D\3.0\1.121\Uh, I did not do a genotype on you.\1.0\\\\P\
71.0\130.0\P\3.0\2.13\Yeah, No, you didn't.\1.0\\\\P\
72.0\131.0\D\3.0\2.1\No, that was before, before we put you on the medicine. \1.0\\\\P\
72.0\132.0\D\3.0\2.1\ That was a while ago.\1.0\\\\P\
73.0\133.0\P\3.0\3.6\Oh, \1.0\\\\P\
73.0\134.0\P\3.0\2.1\you haven't done a recent one.  \1.0\\\\P\
73.0\135.0\P\3.0\1.121\I thought you said in the lab a recent one \1.0\\\\P\
73.0\136.0\P\3.0\1.121\so you can see if I have resistance, no?\1.0\\\\P\
74.0\137.0\D\3.0\3.6\Oh, \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\138.0\D\3.0\3.2\let's see, \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\139.0\D\3.0\2.11\on the um second I did not do a genotype. \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\140.0\D\3.0\2.121\ Let me go back to the note before, \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\141.0\D\3.0\2.1\and that was a walk in \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\142.0\D\3.0\2.51\and that's when you wanted the EKG. \1.0\\\\P\
74.0\143.0\D\3.0\2.11\ I did not do a genotype then.\1.0\\\\P\
75.0\144.0\P\3.0\3.1\ok\1.0\\\\P\
76.0\145.0\D\3.0\6.12\And I'm coming back down here. \1.0\\\\P\
76.0\146.0\D\3.0\2.1\ And this is older, \1.0\\\\P\
76.0\147.0\D\3.0\2.1\back in August. \1.0\\\\P\
76.0\148.0\D\3.0\2.1\ And that's when you had a genotype to determine whether or not you can go on the medication.\1.0\\\\P\
77.0\149.0\P\3.0\1.121\In August?\1.0\\\\P\
78.0\150.0\D\3.0\2.13\Yeah\1.0\\\\P\
79.0\151.0\P\3.0\1.12\So do we need to do another genotype?\1.0\\\\P\
80.0\152.0\D\3.0\2.1\Absolutely not, \1.0\\\\P\
80.0\153.0\D\5.1\5.1\you need to take your medicine.\1.0\\\\P\
81.0\154.0\P\5.1\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\\\\P\
82.0\155.0\D\5.1\2.63\[laughs] \1.0\\\\P\
82.0\156.0\D\5.1\82.1\you need to \1.0\\\\P\
82.0\157.0\D\5.1\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\\\\P\
83.0\158.0\P\5.1\3.6\All right. \1.0\\\\P\
83.0\159.0\P\5.1\2.65\ That's good news to me \1.0\\\\P\
83.0\160.0\P\5.1\2.61\because I was like oh my god.  \1.0\\\\P\
83.0\161.0\P\5.1\2.51\I don't, I don't want to deal with this\1.0\\\\P\
84.0\162.0\D\82.0\82.0\The thing is this week, \1.0\\\\P\
84.0\163.0\D\3.3\2.1\and the Atripla's already written for, \1.0\\\\P\
84.0\164.0\D\3.3\5.3\so let's write the Atripla prescription.\1.0\\\\R\
85.0\165.0\P\3.3\3.1\Okay.\1.0\\\\R\
86.0\166.0\D\3.3\2.1\Cause that's really important. \1.0\\\\P\
86.0\167.0\D\5.14\2.14\ But you you do remember that it's a once a day pill \1.0\\\\P\
86.0\168.0\D\5.14\2.14\we just combined the Sustiva and Truvada to one pill\1.0\\\\P\
87.0\169.0\P\5.14\3.1\yea yeah that's  that right?\1.0\\\\P\
88.0\170.0\D\5.14\2.1\and that is it. \1.0\\\\P\
88.0\171.0\D\5.14\2.43\ You are absolutely right.\1.0\\\\P\
89.0\172.0\P\5.14\1.121\So that's just once a day?\1.0\\\\P\
90.0\173.0\D\5.14\2.1\Once a day, one pill once a day before you go to bed.\1.0\\\\P\
91.0\174.0\P\5.14\1.121\Before I go to bed?\1.0\\\\P\
92.0\175.0\D\5.14\2.13\Well, generally, \1.0\\\\P\
92.0\176.0\D\5.14\2.1\because we always say [2w] sleeping.\1.0\\\\P\
93.0\177.0\P\5.14\3.1\Right, you're right, right.\1.0\\\\P\
94.0\178.0\D\5.14\3.6\Right?  \1.0\\\\P\
94.0\179.0\D\5.2\2.1\so um you haven't had any side effects \1.0\\\\P\
94.0\180.0\D\5.1\2.1\because it's the exact same medicine you were on before, \1.0\\\\P\
94.0\181.0\D\5.1\2.1\just in a once a day pill.\1.0\\\\P\
95.0\182.0\P\5.1\2.65\That's good news. \1.0\\\\P\
95.0\183.0\P\5.1\2.1\ I wasn't thinking I had to a whole regimen.\1.0\\\\P\
96.0\184.0\D\5.1\3.6\No, no, no, no.  \1.0\\\\P\
96.0\185.0\D\5.1\82.1\And the\1.0\\\\P\
97.0\186.0\P\5.1\2.68\I was saying for a week, it's your fault, it's your fault.\1.0\\\\P\
98.0\187.0\D\5.1\4.1\No, don't beat yourself up.  No, don't beat yourself up, no.\1.0\\\\P\
99.0\188.0\P\5.1\2.1\I kept saying that. \1.0\\\\E\
99.0\189.0\P\5.1\2.63\[laughs]\1.0\\\\P\
100.0\190.0\D\3.3\2.1\The whole idea was, here's the Atripla with three refills. \1.0\\\\R\4.2
100.0\191.0\D\5.1\2.2\ Um, and I don't know why she even said you were resistant to it, \1.0\\\\P\
100.0\192.0\D\5.1\2.1\because that is just not true.\1.0\\\\P\
101.0\193.0\P\5.1\3.6\Oh, no, no, \1.0\\\\P\
101.0\194.0\P\5.1\82.1\she, I assumed because\1.0\\\\P\
102.0\195.0\D\5.1\3.1\ahhhhhhhh\1.0\\\\P\
103.0\196.0\P\5.1\82.1\I thought the genotype\1.0\\\\P\
104.0\197.0\D\5.1\2.2\Oh, I see.  Okay.\1.0\\\\P\
105.0\198.0\P\5.1\2.1\And they discontinued it \1.0\\\\P\
105.0\199.0\P\5.1\2.68\and in my mind I was like damn, \1.0\\\\P\
105.0\200.0\P\5.1\2.1\because I hadn't spoke to you, \1.0\\\\P\
105.0\201.0\P\5.1\2.61\oh my god, I I I've built resistance to this medication.\1.0\\\\P\
106.0\202.0\D\5.1\7.0\What's that statement, \1.0\\\\P\
106.0\203.0\D\5.1\7.0\when you assume you make an as out of you and me.\1.0\\\\P\
107.0\204.0\P\5.1\7.0\yeah I I I I\1.0\\\\P\
108.0\205.0\D\5.1\7.0\[laughs]\1.0\\\\P\

110.0\207.0\D\5.1\3.6\All right, \1.0\\\\P\
110.0\208.0\D\3.0\1.12\well did they do vital signs when you came in?\2.0\vital signs\3.1\D\P\
111.0\209.0\P\3.0\2.1\No, \2.0\\\\P\
111.0\210.0\P\3.0\2.1\they took my vital signs \2.0\\\\P\
111.0\211.0\P\3.0\2.4\and um it's not my fault \1.0\\\\P\
111.0\212.0\P\3.0\81.0\[4w].\81.0\\\\\
112.0\213.0\D\3.0\3.6\Okay, \3.0\global health\3.2\P\P\
