Yes. #D,3.0,3.1
How are we gonna do the blood work #D,1.13,1.11
'cause it's time now, right?#D,1.13,1.121
Well what happened with the last one?#P,1.13,1.11
Oh, I can go get that for you. #D,1.13,6.2
I put it in the chart already.#D,1.13,2.11
Yeah, it's time uh.#P,1.13,2.2
It's time anyway. #D,1.13,2.2
It's like -#D,1.13,82.1
Um.#P,1.13,3.1
'Cause last one, actually last one we discussed it.#D,1.13,2.1
No, we didn't.#P,1.13,2.431
637 Tcell count.#D,1.13,2.1
I never talked to you.#P,1.13,2.3
Yeah, look.#D,1.13,2.431
We have been?#P,1.13,1.122
Yeah. #D,1.13,2.1
I think we spoke on the phone, remember?#D,1.13,1.32
No, we spoke on the phone. #P,1.13,2.2
We was playin' phone tag with each other for awhile.#P,1.13,2.2
[Laughs]#D,1.13,2.63
I was trying to get up, catch up with you about my meds.#P,1.13,2.51
Yeah.#D,1.13,2.43
I already did the blood work though.#P,1.13,2.11
Yeah#D,1.13,3.1
I never got the results.#P,1.13,2.1
Yeah, but I, I I put the one we did in October 27th.#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
I put it in there for, #D,1.13,3.2
I'm printing it for you so you could see the difference.#D,1.13,2.11
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
I'm doing it like we usually do in the graph.#D,1.13,2.11
Ah.#P,1.13,3.1
So you can see.#D,1.13,11.0
Ok, now now we gotta find out what we gonna do about me.#P,1.13,6.12
Ok, this is the last Tcell.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok#P,1.13,3.1
637.0#D,1.13,2.1
So you could see, well those are the ones that are plotted right?#D,1.13,1.121
Mhmm.#P,1.13,2.13
There are some of them like in 2005 that's not in there that was from [name of lab]#D,1.13,2.1
Uh huh#P,1.13,3.1
That I didn't put in the computer, #D,1.13,11.0
but these are the ones that I plotted that I put in once I got it from [name of lab].#D,1.13,2.11
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
So the last level that I got was 637, ok?#D,1.13,1.32
Mhmm.#P,1.13,2.2
That's the Tcells. #D,1.13,2.1
And you could see the difference, ok? #D,1.13,1.32
 Not bad at all #D,1.13,2.4
and your viral load was 23,672. . . . #D,1.13,2.1
And that has gone down from about two years ago.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
So how do you feel about that?#D,1.13,1.21
I, well 'cause I really -#P,1.13,3.2
You could keep that.#D,1.13,5.6
I'm not really good on these things.#P,1.13,2.4
You could keep this.#D,1.13,5.6
Ok, I'm alright. #P,1.13,2.4
Which is the good -#P,1.13,2.66
But you wanna talk to your wife I'm sure.#D,1.13,5.5
Which isâ€¦ #P,1.13,3.2
yes, she's gonna discuss this with me anyway#P,1.13,2.121
Ok. #D,1.13,3.6
So you want your viral load to always go down.#D,1.13,2.1
Viral load?#P,1.13,1.122
Viral load.#D,1.13,2.1
We want this to go down.#P,1.13,2.1
So see?  #D,1.13,1.31
Look, it says viral load PCR. #D,1.13,2.1
That's your viral load.#D,1.13,2.1
So this is good?#P,1.13,1.12
That's right. #D,1.13,2.13
Although in 2003 you were only 76. #D,1.13,2.1
That was better. #D,1.13,2.1
So what we're shooting for is a number like this #D,1.13,2.1
or something like 50. #D,1.13,2.1
So this is the best.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
Number you could be -#D,1.13,82.0
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
This is better #D,1.13,2.1
and you had this in 2003.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
So write down, now you want . . down. #D,1.13,5.4
We want it always to go down.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
Ok. #D,1.13,3.6
Now you always want your CD4 count -#D,1.13,82.1
To go up.#P,1.13,2.132
To go up, #D,1.13,2.131
but still this is a good number, right?#D,1.13,1.32
Ok.#P,1.13,2.2
A bad number would be 200 or lower.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
Because if you're 200 and lower, that will be considered you have AIDS -#D,1.13,2.1
I gotta keep these charts for myself.#P,1.13,2.4
That's what I'm saying. #D,1.13,2.43
They're here for you-#D,1.13,2.1
'Cause [name of his Wife]  with charts and things. #P,4.0,2.1
She's not good with paperwork. #P,4.0,2.2
'Cause pap, my paperwork is all over the house.#P,4.0,2.1
[chuckles]#D,4.0,2.63
Hers is tucked away in a drawer. Ya' know .#P,4.0,2.1
Mhmm#D,4.0,3.1
What I'm sayin'?#P,4.0,1.11
Mhmm#D,4.0,3.1
I like to see my paperwork.#P,4.0,2.4
Mhmm.#D,4.0,3.1
and I had to find my dental card today.#P,4.0,2.51
Mhmm.#D,4.0,3.1
But I thought it was my Medicaid card.#P,4.0,2.2
[Chuckles] #D,4.0,2.63
 So that that's what it is. #D,4.0,2.1
Your CD4 count represents your immunity.#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
Your immune system. #D,1.13,2.1
How is your immune system working. #D,1.13,2.1
Is it holding on?#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
Ya' know like we just talked about in the group?#D,1.13,2.14
In there.#P,1.13,82.0
Like uh there are certain vaccine if we give you, if your immune system is not good -#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
You don't, you don't take, you don't build up an antibody. #D,1.13,2.1
So because this represents your immune system, therefore you always want it to be up.#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
Above 200 because anything 200 or less is considered AIDS.#D,1.13,11.0
Mhmm, ok.#P,1.13,2.2
Alright? #D,1.13,1.31
 And I wrote that down here for you.#D,1.13,2.11
Ok#P,1.13,3.1
The viral load . . right?  #D,1.13,1.12
I'm gonna write it down for you. #D,1.13,6.2
Viral load . . that represent#D,1.13,82.0
When I met you it was this?#P,1.13,1.12
Mhmm.#D,1.13,2.13
70.0#P,1.13,2.1
Mhmm, 2003.#D,1.13,2.1
Wow! #P,1.13,2.64
 I didn't know that.#P,1.13,2.2
Yeah, but you've been on and off of your meds too. Remember? #D,1.13,1.32
 There were times you don't take it #D,5.11,2.1
and you skip.#D,5.11,11.0
Uh huh.#P,5.0,2.2
Now the thing is that's how people develop resistance. #D,5.0,2.1
That's why at times we have to change people's medication.#D,5.0,2.1
Ok.#P,5.0,3.1
Now viral load, it represents how much HIV virus -#D,1.13,82.1
In the system.#P,1.13,2.132
In the system. . . . #D,1.13,2.131
Really in your body.#D,1.13,11.0
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
So the higher the viral load.#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm#P,1.13,3.1
The higher you have viruses running in your system.#D,1.13,11.0
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
That can cause damage.#D,1.13,11.0
Oh, ok.#P,1.13,2.2
That's why it's recommended for us to keep the viral load below.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,3.1
Whereas your immunity, you want that to be high.#D,1.13,2.1
Mhmm.#P,1.13,3.1
Ok?  #D,1.13,1.31
That's what it represents CD4 count.#D,1.13,2.1
Ok.#P,1.13,2.2
Ok?#D,1.13,1.32
Ok.#P,1.13,2.2
So as you keep on getting into to [name of lab] although they're not showing here, #D,1.13,2.121
I'm gonna keep on fighting them for you.#D,1.13,2.121
No, #P,2.9,2.1
I'm not, I, I'm not I'm not I can't go through [name of lab] anymore.#P,2.9,2.1
What are we doing?#D,2.9,1.11
We're, we're goin' through somebody else #P,2.9,2.1
and I don't know who the hell we're goin' through.#P,2.9,2.69
I thought, mm, we're not goin' through [name of lab] in terms of what?  #D,2.9,1.122
In terms of blood work?#D,2.9,1.122
Yeah.#P,2.9,2.13
Where are we goin'? #D,2.9,1.12
[chuckles]#D,2.9,2.63
I don't know. #P,2.9,2.2
We have to go someplace else.#P,2.9,2.1
Ah.#D,2.9,2.64
My wife told me we had to go someplace else #P,2.9,2.1
because they're not takin' um, the insurance that we're on.#P,2.9,2.1
Ok.#D,2.9,3.1
So.#P,2.9,3.2
Ok. #D,2.9,3.6
So now you are in [name of insurance company]?#D,2.9,1.12
You know something? #P,2.9,1.12
 I don't really know.#P,2.9,2.2

So does she know?#D,2.9,1.12
I've been workin' so hard it's just like -#P,2.9,82.1
Does she know where you have to go because -#D,2.9,82.1
She she she knows.#P,2.9,2.1

Does that sound familiar?#D,2.9,1.12
Do you have that?#P,2.9,1.12
We don't have it, #D,2.9,2.1
but there are places we send people to. #D,2.9,2.1
I just need to know so I know what form to give you #D,2.9,2.1
or if you find out from her you call me #D,2.9,5.4

Uh huh.#P,2.9,3.1
I can do that.#D,2.9,6.3
What time is it?#P,4.0,1.12
It's 1224.#D,4.0,2.1

But what did I say though about that?#D,8.0,1.12
What? #P,8.0,1.121
 That could be fat?#P,8.0,1.12
No, I told you we need to do an echocardiogram about that. #D,8.0,2.51
'cause that's on and off on you. #D,8.0,2.1
We need to do a stress test. #D,8.0,2.121
We need to check your heart.#D,8.0,2.121
Yeah.#P,8.0,3.1
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. #D,8.0,2.1
That's not, that that we have to send you upstairs for a test.#D,8.0,2.121

It's not it's not a simple thing like that.#D,8.0,2.1
Ok.#P,8.0,3.1
Ok?  #D,8.0,1.32
And when you do the blood work there's certain blood works that I can check for you that's directly related to the heart.#D,8.0,2.121
So in other words I have to -#P,8.0,82.1
