5.0\6.0\P\3.0\3.1\ok\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\7.0\D\3.0\2.1\I had it all in front of me.  \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\8.0\D\3.0\2.121\I'll be right back.  \4.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\9.0\D\3.0\2.51\I was going to grab it when I walked by. \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\10.0\D\99.0\99.0\ [Doctor leaves the room for 30 seconds] \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
6.0\11.0\D\3.0\3.3\Okay, now\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\12.0\P\1.13\5.2\Let's see what my viral load \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\13.0\P\1.13\5.2\and my CD4 count are. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
7.0\14.0\P\1.13\2.5\ I love to hear it.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\15.0\D\1.13\3.6\Okay, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\16.0\D\1.13\82.0\it's, uh, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\17.0\D\1.13\2.11\I already looked at it. \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\18.0\D\1.13\2.1\ It's good, \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\19.0\D\1.13\2.1\although it's from June, June 27th. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\20.0\D\1.13\2.1\ So we don't have a recent one.  \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
8.0\21.0\D\3.0\1.22\You remember getting your blood drawn here since then?\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
9.0\22.0\P\3.0\2.2\No, not really.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
10.0\23.0\D\3.0\1.121\no?\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
11.0\24.0\P\3.0\2.5\We need blood work done.  \5.0\2.0\new blood work\2.1\P\R\
11.0\25.0\P\3.0\2.5\We need more recent.\4.0\2.0\\\P\R\
12.0\26.0\D\3.0\2.12\Unless, they made you a new chart \7.0\1.0\blood work logistics\\\P\
12.0\27.0\D\3.0\2.2\and I don't know why \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
12.0\28.0\D\3.0\82.0\and so the only other thing would be if you went, \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
12.0\29.0\D\3.0\1.12\do your labs get covered through Quest or Lab Corp? \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
12.0\30.0\D\3.0\82.1\ Or do they get covered\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
13.0\31.0\P\3.0\2.1\Downstairs.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
14.0\32.0\D\3.0\1.122\You get them done downstairs?\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\33.0\P\3.0\2.13\Umhum, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
15.0\34.0\P\3.0\2.1\all the time.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
16.0\35.0\D\3.0\3.2\Well, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
16.0\36.0\D\3.0\82.0\there is one other thing I can do is see if you . . . . .  \17.0\1.0\\\\R\
16.0\37.0\D\3.0\82.0\I was trying to see if you \7.0\1.0\\\\R\
16.0\38.0\D\3.0\2.5\they had it written anywhere where your last one was done, \11.0\1.0\\\\R\4.2
16.0\39.0\D\3.0\2.1\so, because given that you have this other chart, \9.0\1.0\\\\P\
16.0\40.0\D\3.0\2.1\or this chart, \3.0\1.0\\\\P\
16.0\41.0\D\3.0\1.12\is there anyway that you have labs that were done at Lab Corp\13.0\1.0\\\\P\
17.0\42.0\P\3.0\2.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
18.0\43.0\D\3.0\2.1\so if you have them done downstairs, \7.0\1.0\\\\I\
18.0\44.0\D\3.0\2.1\depending on your insurance, sometimes they'll send it to Lab Corp, \11.0\1.0\\\\I\
18.0\45.0\D\3.0\2.1\send it to Quest\4.0\1.0\\\\I\
19.0\46.0\P\3.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
20.0\47.0\D\3.0\2.1\and then they fax it back to us \8.0\1.0\\\\I\
20.0\48.0\D\3.0\2.12\so it would be on the computer.\7.0\1.0\\\\I\
21.0\49.0\P\3.0\3.1\Uhhuh.\1.0\1.0\\\\I\
22.0\50.0\D\3.0\1.12\But has your insurance changed since June?\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
23.0\51.0\P\3.0\2.1\No, humum.\2.0\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\52.0\D\3.0\3.6\You have the same insurance \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
24.0\53.0\D\3.0\2.12\so then we had it on the same computer.\9.0\1.0\\\\I\
25.0\54.0\P\3.0\2.13\Yep, same insurance.\3.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\55.0\D\3.0\2.14\I saw you on June 27th, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
26.0\56.0\D\3.0\2.14\you had your labs drawn June 27th.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
27.0\57.0\P\3.0\2.13\Yeah, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
27.0\58.0\P\3.0\2.1\the day before my birthday.\5.0\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\59.0\D\3.0\3.2\Well, \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
28.0\60.0\D\3.0\2.12\my guess is we haven't had it since then\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
29.0\61.0\P\3.0\2.13\mhm\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
30.0\62.0\D\3.0\2.121\but I'll tell you what those ones are, \8.0\1.0\\\\A\
30.0\63.0\D\3.0\5.4\but either way, we need to get them today.\9.0\1.0\\\\P\
31.0\64.0\P\3.0\6.21\Right, right.  No problem.\4.0\1.0\\\\P\
32.0\65.0\D\1.13\2.1\But they look good.\4.0\3.0\test results\4.22\D\P\
33.0\66.0\P\11.0\11.0\Everything done today.\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
34.0\67.0\D\1.13\2.1\So on June 27th, your viral load was undetectable, \9.0\3.0\\\\P\
34.0\68.0\D\1.13\2.1\so less than 50, \4.0\3.0\\\\P\
34.0\69.0\D\1.13\2.1\so perfect\2.0\3.0\\\\P\
35.0\70.0\P\1.13\3.1\yeah\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
36.0\71.0\D\1.13\2.1\and your CD4 count was 630\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
37.0\72.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
38.0\73.0\D\1.13\2.1\which is very good, \4.0\3.0\\\\P\
38.0\74.0\D\1.13\2.1\nice and high with a high percent 30%.\8.0\3.0\\\\P\
39.0\75.0\P\1.13\3.1\ok.  All right.\3.0\3.0\\\\P\
40.0\76.0\D\1.13\2.1\And your one before that says 727\7.0\3.0\\\\P\
41.0\77.0\P\1.13\3.1\mhm\1.0\3.0\\\\P\
42.0\78.0\D\1.13\2.1\so you've bounced a bit, \5.0\3.0\\\\P\
42.0\79.0\D\1.13\2.1\but you are way up high.\6.0\3.0\\\\P\
43.0\80.0\P\1.13\3.6\Right. \1.0\3.0\\\\P\
43.0\81.0\P\1.13\2.2\ As long as I stay up in those high numbers, I'm fine.\12.0\3.0\\\\P\
44.0\82.0\D\1.13\2.65\I've very happy with the numbers too, so.\8.0\3.0\\\\P\
45.0\83.0\P\1.13\3.1\Okay.\1.0\3.0\\\\P\

87.0\145.0\P\1.15\3.6\Okay.\1.0\8.0\\\\P\
88.0\146.0\D\1.15\2.1\Your glucose, it depends on whether you have eaten or not\11.0\8.0\\\\I\
89.0\147.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\1.0\8.0\\\\I\
90.0\148.0\D\1.15\11.0\how we interpret the numbers.  \5.0\8.0\\\\I\
90.0\149.0\D\1.15\2.1\Last time your glucose was 69 \6.0\8.0\\\\P\
90.0\150.0\D\1.15\2.1\which is great.\3.0\8.0\\\\P\

96.0\159.0\D\1.15\3.6\Okay, \1.0\8.0\\\\P\
96.0\160.0\D\1.15\2.12\so it might be higher when we check it today \10.0\8.0\\\\P\
96.0\161.0\D\1.15\2.1\because it's responding to your eating\6.0\8.0\\\\P\
97.0\162.0\P\1.15\3.1\ok\1.0\8.0\\\\P\

201.0\375.0\D\2.5\2.4\and it was like she went back 10 years in her memory\12.0\14.0\\\\P\
202.0\376.0\P\2.5\2.64\really?\1.0\14.0\\\\P\
203.0\377.0\D\2.5\2.4\and her functioning \3.0\14.0\\\\P\
203.0\378.0\D\2.5\2.12\because she was kind of in this totally familiar environment, \10.0\14.0\\\\P\
203.0\379.0\D\2.5\2.1\so you see that.\4.0\14.0\\\\P\
204.0\380.0\P\2.5\3.6\Uhhuh, right.\2.0\14.0\\\\P\5.0
205.0\381.0\D\2.5\2.4\It will be good for her to have you go out there.\12.0\12.0\mother\\\E\
206.0\382.0\P\2.5\2.121\You know, I am going to ask the doctor about that.  \11.0\12.0\\\\E\
206.0\383.0\P\2.5\2.121\You know, ask me if that could possibly have anything to do with what's going on with her now.\19.0\12.0\\\\P\
207.0\384.0\D\2.5\2.12\I mean, I think they will probably say, if she has pneumonia\12.0\12.0\\\\P\
208.0\385.0\P\2.5\3.1\mhm\1.0\12.0\\\\P\
209.0\386.0\D\2.5\2.4\somebody who's 85 will get confused when they have pneumonia\10.0\12.0\\\\P\

211.0\388.0\D\2.5\5.1\you just have to wait and see how she does, if she recovers.\13.0\12.0\\\\P\
212.0\389.0\P\2.5\3.6\Yeah, yeah\2.0\12.0\\\\P\
213.0\390.0\D\2.5\82.0\but\1.0\12.0\\\\P\
214.0\391.0\P\11.0\11.0\okay.\1.0\12.0\\\\P\
215.0\392.0\D\2.5\5.1\let's see what they say, \5.0\12.0\\\\E\
215.0\393.0\D\2.5\5.7\that's a good question\4.0\12.0\\\\E\
216.0\394.0\P\2.5\3.6\All right.\2.0\12.0\\\\P\
217.0\395.0\D\82.0\82.1\So\1.0\12.0\\\\P\
218.0\396.0\P\3.3\2.1\So, I need refills on the HCTZ, \7.0\15.0\refills\1.0\P\P\

218.0\399.0\P\6.0\2.1\and something to help me sleep.\6.0\13.0\sleep med\\\P\
219.0\400.0\D\6.0\3.6\Okay, \1.0\13.0\\\\P\
219.0\401.0\D\2.2\1.12\are you using anything now?\5.0\13.0\\\\P\

221.0\403.0\D\2.1\3.6\OK. \1.0\13.0\\\\P\
221.0\404.0\D\6.0\5.1\ What I would do as first line is try using Benadryl \11.0\13.0\\\\R\2.1
221.0\405.0\D\6.0\2.121\because it's your sleep system will not become dependent on Benadryl\11.0\13.0\\\\I\
222.0\406.0\P\6.0\3.1\mhm\1.0\13.0\\\\I\
223.0\407.0\D\6.0\2.1\and it works. \3.0\13.0\\\\I\
223.0\408.0\D\6.0\2.1\ Like it's the first line that they use in the hospital when someone can't sleep.\15.0\13.0\\\\I\
224.0\409.0\P\6.0\1.122\You are talking about Benadryl the cough syrup?\8.0\13.0\\\\P\

225.0\411.0\D\6.0\2.1\it makes you sleepy, \4.0\13.0\\\\P\
225.0\412.0\D\6.0\2.63\[chuckles] \1.0\13.0\\\\P\
225.0\413.0\D\6.0\2.1\so in the hospital they actually use it to help people go to sleep. \14.0\13.0\\\\I\
225.0\414.0\D\6.0\5.1\ You can try one \4.0\13.0\\\\P\
225.0\415.0\D\6.0\5.1\and if that doesn't work, you can take two.\9.0\13.0\\\\P\
226.0\416.0\P\6.0\3.6\Uhhuh, \1.0\13.0\\\\P\
226.0\417.0\P\6.0\1.122\of the tablets.\3.0\13.0\\\\P\

227.0\420.0\D\6.0\2.12\ I think it's probably can get over the counter, \9.0\13.0\\\\P\
227.0\421.0\D\6.0\6.3\but I can write down the generic name of it, \10.0\13.0\\\\P\
227.0\422.0\D\6.0\2.1\diphenhydramine.\1.0\13.0\\\\P\
228.0\423.0\P\2.9\2.51\I was trying not to buy it, \7.0\13.0\\\\R\

235.0\434.0\D\6.0\2.1\They are not supposed to be used long term \9.0\13.0\\\\I\
235.0\435.0\D\6.0\82.0\and they do have, \4.0\13.0\\\\I\
235.0\436.0\D\6.0\2.1\it's not like you are addicted to them, \8.0\13.0\\\\P\
235.0\437.0\D\6.0\2.1\but you get dependent onto them.\6.0\13.0\\\\P\
236.0\438.0\P\6.0\3.6\That's fine, doctor, \3.0\13.0\\\\P\
236.0\439.0\P\6.0\5.2\just if you give me a small amount of something for like the next week or so.\17.0\13.0\\\\R\
