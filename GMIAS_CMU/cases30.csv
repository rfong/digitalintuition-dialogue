208.0\426.0\D\1.14\2.1\ Your temperature is normal here today, \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
208.0\427.0\D\1.12\2.1\but we have seen a lot of people with flu bugs, \11.0\1.0\\\\P\
208.0\428.0\D\1.12\2.1\and viruses can, especially, cause severe muscle pain \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
208.0\429.0\D\1.12\2.1\and tenderness. \2.0\1.0\\\\P\
208.0\430.0\D\8.0\2.1\ The treatments would be rest \5.0\1.0\\\\R\

209.0\432.0\P\8.0\3.1\Yeah.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
210.0\433.0\D\6.0\2.1\And Aleve, \2.0\1.0\\\\R\

210.0\435.0\D\6.0\1.121\And that seems to help relieve your discomfort when you do those things.\13.0\1.0\\\\P\
211.0\436.0\P\1.14\2.1\But when I lay down too much\7.0\1.0\\\\P\

213.0\438.0\P\1.14\11.0\That's when my body feels really sore.\7.0\1.0\\\\P\
214.0\439.0\D\1.14\3.6\Okay. \1.0\1.0\\\\P\
214.0\440.0\D\1.12\2.4\ The other possibility is that you have some inflammation in the muscles, \12.0\1.0\\\\P\
214.0\441.0\D\3.0\6.3\but we can check a blood test to make sure there's nothing going on with the muscles, \17.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
214.0\442.0\D\3.0\2.1\and that's really easy to do. \6.0\1.0\\\\R\
214.0\443.0\D\3.0\6.2\ So I will check that.  \5.0\1.0\\\\R\
214.0\444.0\D\3.0\6.2\And if there's anything abnormal with those tests, I will contact you by phone right away.\16.0\1.0\\\\R\
215.0\445.0\P\3.0\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\R\
216.0\446.0\D\1.12\2.4\Okay? But assuming that there's no muscle inflammation, you know, that the muscle enzymes are normal, I think we would probably feel like this is probably a, um, a mild viral syndrome \32.0\1.0\\\\R\1.3
216.0\447.0\D\1.12\2.4\that will go away with time. \6.0\1.0\\\\P\
216.0\448.0\D\1.14\4.1\ I know it's really preoccupying you. \6.0\1.0\\\\E\
216.0\449.0\D\1.14\4.1\ I can see it on your face you're very worried and concerned.  \12.0\1.0\\\\E\

216.0\451.0\D\6.0\5.1\I think we can make you feel better, though, by giving you some prescription strength Aleve \16.0\1.0\\\\R\

218.0\455.0\D\6.0\2.1\Cuz it is long acting, \5.0\1.0\\\\R\
218.0\456.0\D\6.0\5.1\and I think it would give you better pain relief, \10.0\1.0\\\\P\
218.0\457.0\D\6.0\5.1\make you feel more comfortable.  \5.0\1.0\\\\P\
218.0\458.0\D\8.0\5.1\I would encourage you to, um, drink plenty of fluids, okay, \11.0\1.0\\\\R\2.1
218.0\459.0\D\8.0\5.1\with salts \2.0\1.0\\\\R\
218.0\460.0\D\8.0\5.1\and sugar in them, \4.0\1.0\\\\R\
218.0\461.0\D\8.0\2.1\so that you can get some energy, \7.0\1.0\\\\P\
218.0\462.0\D\1.14\2.121\um, and then we'll see what happens with your appetite. \10.0\1.0\\\\P\

218.0\464.0\D\1.14\2.1\You haven't lost any weight, though, significant weight, \8.0\1.0\\\\P\
218.0\465.0\D\1.14\2.46\so I'm not too worried, \5.0\1.0\\\\P\

219.0\467.0\P\1.14\3.1\Okay.\1.0\1.0\\\\P\
