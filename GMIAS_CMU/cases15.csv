165\277\D\2.2000\3.100\mhm\\6.0\\\\P\
166\278\P\2.2000\82.000\which is so\\6.0\\\\P\
167\279\D\2.2000\2.400\Well that's the addition.  That's addition.\\6.0\\\\P\
168\280\P\2.2000\2.431\That's not, \\6.0\\\\P\
168\281\P\2.2000\2.400\I'm not addicted.  \\6.0\\\\P\
168\282\P\2.2000\2.510\It's not like, each time I wanted to do, \\6.0\\\\P\
168\283\P\2.2000\2.400\addiction, to me addition is, \\6.0\\\\P\
168\284\P\2.2000\5.600\and correct me if I'm wrong, \\6.0\\\\P\
168\285\P\2.2000\11.000\to me addiction is day in, day out, constantly in your mind.  That's addiction to me.  \\6.0\\\\P\
168\286\P\1.1600\2.400\Like smoking cigarettes, \\7.0\smoking\2.2\P\P\
168\287\P\1.1600\2.500\I'm addicted to cigarettes, okay?\\7.0\\\\P\
169\288\D\1.1600\3.100\Mhm.\\7.0\\\\P\

174\293\P\1.1600\2.400\You know, that's, it's still in a social phase.\\6.0\\\\P\
175\294\D\1.1600\3.100\Okay.\\6.0\\\\P\
176\295\P\1.1600\81.000\[5w] you know\\6.0\\\\P\
177\296\D\1.1600\1.122\by not getting high?\\6.0\\\\P\
178\297\P\1.1600\2.130\Yeah, \\6.0\\\\P\
178\298\P\1.1600\2.400\getting high is still in a social phase, \\6.0\\\\P\
178\299\P\1.1600\2.400\it's not like I have to get high.  \\6.0\\\\P\
178\300\P\2.2000\2.500\You know, I don't wake up and my first thought is,  I want a hit of coke.  \\6.0\\\\P\
178\301\P\2.2000\2.100\ You know, that doesn't happen, all right?\\6.0\\\\P\
179\302\D\2.2000\3.600\All right.\\6.0\\\\P\
180\303\P\2.2000\2.100\It's more so, friends will call up,  \\6.0\\\\P\
180\304\P\2.2000\2.100\What are doing today?  \\6.0\\\\P\
180\305\P\2.2000\2.100\You want to come over? \\6.0\\\\P\
180\306\P\2.2000\2.100\ You want to get high? \\6.0\\\\P\
180\307\P\2.2000\2.100\ You want to get freaky?  \\6.0\\\\P\
180\308\P\2.2000\2.500\ You know and,  All right, no, \\6.0\\\\P\
180\309\P\2.2000\2.500\I'm not in the mood. \\6.0\\\\P\
180\310\P\2.2000\82.000\  So you know I can, \\6.0\\\\P\
180\311\P\2.2000\2.400\that's, I wouldn't say that I have an addiction, \\6.0\\\\P\
180\312\P\2.2000\2.100\although I do have a friend who constantly tells me that we are addicted.\\6.0\\\\P\
181\313\D\2.2000\3.100\Mhm.\\6.0\\\\P\
182\314\P\2.2000\82.000\so\\6.0\\\\P\
183\315\D\2.2000\2.100\Well I can tell you from a factual standpoint, you know, you don't have to be using every day to be addicted.\\6.0\\\\R\
184\316\P\2.2000\3.100\Okay.\\6.0\\\\R\
185\317\D\2.2000\2.100\Your body can be addicted to something that you're not using every day.  \\6.0\\\\R\
185\318\D\2.2000\2.100\Just biologically.\\6.0\\\\R\
186\319\P\2.2000\3.100\hm\\6.0\\\\R\
187\320\D\2.2000\2.400\You know.  But when I hear you saying that, what I hear really is that you haven't fully accepted that this is a problem for you. \\6.0\\\\R\
187\321\D\2.2000\2.400\ You don't really fully see that this might be affecting your life, using \\6.0\\\\R\
187\322\D\2.2000\2.400\drinking and using I mean, ok? \\6.0\\\\R\1.3
187\323\D\2.2000\1.220\ Does that sound true?\\6.0\\\\R\
188\324\P\2.2000\2.400\Yeah, yeah that sounds true\\6.0\\\\R\
189\325\D\2.2000\4.100\So really, that's okay. \\6.0\\\\R\
189\326\D\2.2000\4.100\ That's where you are, I mean, \\6.0\\\\R\
189\327\D\2.2000\2.120\but then really we're probably not at a stage where stopping \\6.0\\\\R\
189\328\D\2.2000\2.120\or may setting a date is not gonna be a priority for you.\\6.0\\\\R\
190\329\P\2.2000\2.431\That's not true.  \\6.0\\\\R\
190\330\P\2.2000\82.000\I, before I allowed into, \\6.0\\\\R\
190\331\P\2.2000\2.140\if you remember my quote last time, \\6.0\\\\R\
190\332\P\2.2000\2.110\turning from sugar to shit, I've always put it down \\6.0\\\\R\
190\333\P\2.2000\82.000\but lately\\6.0\\\\R\
191\334\D\2.2000\3.100\Mhm.\\6.0\\\\R\
192\335\P\2.2000\11.000\Honestly. \\6.0\\\\R\
192\336\P\2.2000\2.200\ And from what you just said, I don't, yes and no to that question.  The answer to that question is yes and no, honestly.  \\6.0\\\\R\
192\337\P\2.2000\2.400\I think it's becoming a problem.  I think it's becoming a problem.\\6.0\\\\R\
193\338\D\2.2000\3.100\Okay.\\6.0\\\\R\
194\339\P\2.2000\2.400\But my definition of addiction, \\6.0\\\\P\
194\340\P\2.2000\2.400\maybe I should look up, \\6.0\\\\P\
194\341\P\2.2000\11.000\that's just like definition of addiction, \\6.0\\\\P\
194\342\P\2.2000\2.400\because I don't, I don't, I don't think I wake up thinking, \\6.0\\\\P\
194\343\P\2.2000\2.500\you know, it's not like I'm gonna prostitute myself for any, like, you know\\6.0\\\\P\
195\344\D\2.2000\3.600\Yeah, \\6.0\\\\P\
195\345\D\2.2000\82.100\well you know you\\6.0\\\\P\
196\346\P\2.2000\2.500\I'm not going to stop bathing, you know \\6.0\\\\P\
196\347\P\2.2000\2.500\I'm not going to stop, that, \\6.0\\\\P\
196\348\P\2.2000\2.400\but that's how I see an addiction.\\6.0\\\\P\
197\349\D\1.1300\1.210\So tell me what you think your viral load is going to be like [3w]?\\6.0\\\\R\
198\350\P\1.1300\2.400\Same as\\6.0\\\\R\
199\351\D\1.1300\1.121\Suppressed?\\6.0\\\\R\
200\352\P\1.1300\2.130\It's suppressed.\\6.0\\\\R\
201\353\D\1.1300\1.121\You're less than 50?  \\6.0\\\\R\
201\354\D\5.1100\1.121\I mean you've been missing the medicine?\\6.0\\\\R\
202\355\P\5.1100\2.110\It's not that many.\\6.0\\\\R\
203\356\D\1.1300\2.140\Because last time you indicated to me that you thought maybe your viral load might go up.\\6.0\\\\R\
204\357\P\1.1300\1.122\coming down?\\6.0\\\\R\
205\358\D\1.1300\1.121\Because, I mean the CD4s might come down a few cell \\6.0\\\\R\
205\359\D\5.1100\1.121\because you have been missing medicine a lot.\\6.0\\\\R\
206\360\P\5.1100\2.110\right\\6.0\\\\R\
207\361\D\5.1140\1.121\So, that's the effect.  I mean, the major effect to be using, [3w]?\\6.0\\\\R\
208\362\P\5.1140\2.130\Right.  Right.  \\6.0\\\\R\
208\363\P\5.1110\2.110\I mean the only reason I missed those doses is because I wasn't home to take them.\\6.0\\\\R\
209\364\D\5.1110\1.110\Why weren't you home?\\6.0\\\\R\
210\365\P\5.1140\2.110\Because I was somewhere else partying.  \\6.0\\\\R\
210\366\P\5.1140\2.110\[5w] enjoying.\\6.0\\\\R\
211\367\D\5.1100\5.200\So connect the dots for me, \\6.0\\\\R\
211\368\D\5.1100\1.122\So you're not taking the medicines \\6.0\\\\R\
211\369\D\5.1110\1.122\because you're out, not at home, \\6.0\\\\R\
211\370\D\5.1100\1.122\you're not taking the medicine \\6.0\\\\R\
211\371\D\1.1300\1.122\so your CD4 count's falling\\6.0\\\\R\
212\372\P\1.1300\2.680\you don't have to tell me that.\\6.0\\\\R\
213\373\D\1.1300\3.700\I'm just saying, \\6.0\\\\R\
213\374\D\1.1300\1.121\you're the one who told me,  I knew this was going to happen,  right?\\6.0\\\\R\
214\375\P\1.1300\2.130\Right.  Right.\\6.0\\\\R\
215\376\D\1.1300\1.220\So don't you think that being out might be having an effect on your CD4 cells? \\6.0\\\\R\
215\377\D\5.1100\1.221\ I think keeping you from taking your medicines that are sustaining you, \\6.0\\\\R\
215\378\D\5.1100\1.221\that are keeping the virus undetectable, \\6.0\\\\R\
215\379\D\5.1100\1.221\then you're going to tell me it's not having an impact on you?\\6.0\\\\R\
216\380\P\5.1100\2.430\yeah I guess it does\\6.0\\\\R\
217\381\D\2.2000\2.400\I mean you don't have to be\\6.0\\\\R\
218\382\P\5.1100\2.132\A rocket scientist?\\6.0\\\\R\
219\383\D\2.2000\2.431\No, \\6.0\\\\R\
219\384\D\2.2000\5.500\you don't have to be homeless \\6.0\\\\R\
219\385\D\2.2000\5.500\and in the streets \\6.0\\\\R\
219\386\D\2.2000\5.500\and you know stealing from people \\6.0\\\\R\
219\387\D\2.2000\5.500\to be having these things have an effect on your life, you know? \\6.0\\\\R\
219\388\D\1.1300\2.140\ You haven't had your blood since August, \\6.0\\\\R\
219\389\D\1.1300\1.121\and the reason is because you don't want to see what that result looks like during that time, yes or no?\\6.0\\\\R\
220\390\P\1.1300\2.130\Yes.\\6.0\\\\R\
221\391\D\2.2000\2.400\So I, I think that, I think you've like compartmentalized, you know, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\392\D\2.2000\2.400\you're a smart person, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\393\D\2.2000\2.400\so you put these things in boxes, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\394\D\2.2000\2.400\and that way you can say,  This is the party aspect, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\395\D\2.2000\2.400\this is my health aspect, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\396\D\2.2000\2.400\these are different things in my life, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\397\D\2.2000\2.400\and they don't have anything to do with each other, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\398\D\2.2000\2.400\and as long as I am taking a shower every day, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\399\D\2.2000\2.400\and eating \\6.0\\\\R\
221\400\D\2.2000\2.400\and my weight is stable \\6.0\\\\R\
221\401\D\2.2000\2.400\and I'm not on the street, \\6.0\\\\R\
221\402\D\2.2000\2.400\and I'm not stealing, then using drugs \\6.0\\\\R\

318\602\P\1.1400\2.630\[Laughs]. \\2.0\\\\P\
318\603\P\1.1400\2.100\ Just a little skin irritation, \\2.0\\\\P\
318\604\P\1.1400\2.100\itching.\\2.0\\\\P\
319\605\D\1.1400\1.122\Itching?\\2.0\\\\P\
320\606\P\1.1400\2.130\Yeah.\\2.0\\\\P\
321\607\D\1.1400\3.600\Okay. \\2.0\\\\P\
321\608\D\1.1400\82.000\ Let's just make sure. . . . . . . \\2.0\\\\P\
321\609\D\1.1400\82.000\ So as far as, \\2.0\\\\P\
321\610\D\1.1400\3.300\I'll tell you what I'm trying to get at here a little bit. \\2.0\\\\P\
321\611\D\1.1400\1.121\ So when I think about somebody who tells me that they're fatigued.  Fatigued basically means that even when you get sleep, you still feel that you need sleep.\\2.0\\\\P\
322\612\P\1.1400\2.130\Mhm.\\2.0\\\\P\
323\613\D\1.1400\1.121\So, um and your body is tired.  \\2.0\\\\P\
323\614\D\1.1400\1.121\It's not just that you're sleepy \\2.0\\\\P\
323\615\D\1.1400\1.121\and you want to lay down and go to bed, \\2.0\\\\P\
323\616\D\1.1400\1.121\it's that you feel like, like jellylegged, \\2.0\\\\P\
323\617\D\1.1400\1.121\like what you said. \\2.0\\\\P\
323\618\D\1.1400\82.000\ So it's really, \\2.0\\\\P\
323\619\D\1.1400\2.100\fatigue as a medical term means more than just tiredness, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\620\D\1.1400\2.100\it means that your body is tired, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\621\D\1.1400\2.100\and that even when you sleep, you're not rested.  \\2.0\\\\R\
323\622\D\1.1200\2.100\So when I start thinking about fatigue, there's a lot of things that can cause fatigue. \\2.0\\\\R\
323\623\D\1.1200\82.000\ I mean, simple things like, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\624\D\1.1200\2.100\so first of all things like certain vitamin deficiencies, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\625\D\1.1200\2.100\and problems with your thyroid, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\626\D\1.1200\3.200\things like that. \\2.0\\\\R\1.3
323\627\D\1.1500\82.000\ So we can do some, \\2.0\\\\R\
323\628\D\3.0000\2.400\you know, it's too bad you just got your blood drawn,  \\2.0\\\\P\
323\629\D\3.0000\2.630\[chuckles] \\2.0\\\\P\
323\630\D\1.1500\5.100\but the next time you get your blood drawn in a couple weeks we can check some of these things.\\2.0\\\\R\4.4
324\631\P\1.1500\1.121\Didn't we just [4w]?\\2.0\\\\P\
325\632\D\1.1500\1.122\The nutrition, what's that?\\2.0\\\\P\
326\633\P\1.1500\1.121\You still can't check one?\\2.0\\\\P\
327\634\D\1.1500\2.130\Yeah yeah.  \\2.0\\\\P\
327\635\D\1.1500\82.000\I mean it's not, it's, \\2.0\\\\P\
327\636\D\1.1500\5.100\we should check them the next time we get your blood work\\2.0\\\\R\
328\637\P\1.1500\3.600\Okay.\\2.0\\\\R\
329\638\D\1.1500\5.100\We'll check some vitamin levels \\2.0\\\\R\
329\639\D\1.1500\5.100\and we'll check your thyroid test \\2.0\\\\R\
329\640\D\1.1500\5.100\just to make sure you're okay.\\2.0\\\\R\
330\641\P\1.0000\1.120\um,  where is thyroids?\\2.0\\\\I\
331\642\D\1.0000\2.100\Mhm.  It's in your neck.\\2.0\\\\I\
332\643\P\1.0000\3.600\Okay. \\2.0\\\\I\
332\644\P\1.0000\2.630\ [Laughs].  \\2.0\\\\P\
332\645\P\1.1400\82.000\I've never, \\2.0\\\\P\

334\649\P\1.1400\11.000\thyroid \\2.0\\\\P\
334\650\P\1.1400\2.400\and I always assumed it was a woman's thing\\2.0\\\\P\
335\651\D\1.1400\1.120\Did you hear them have thyroid problems?\\2.0\\\\P\
336\652\P\1.1400\2.100\Yeah, \\2.0\\\\P\
336\653\P\1.1400\2.100\my mom does.\\2.0\\\\P\
337\654\D\1.1400\1.110\What what kind?\\2.0\\\\P\
338\655\P\1.1400\2.200\I, I don't know exactly but\\2.0\\\\P\
339\656\D\1.1400\81.000\[2w]\\2.0\\\\P\
340\657\P\1.1400\2.100\But she takes some type of medicine\\2.0\\\\P\
341\658\D\1.1400\1.122\She does?\\2.0\\\\P\
342\659\P\1.1400\2.130\yeah\\2.0\\\\P\
343\660\D\1.1400\1.110\What were you going to say a minute ago?\\2.0\\\\P\
344\661\P\1.1400\2.100\No I don't.  Uh uh.\\2.0\\\\P\
345\662\D\1.1200\3.300\Another thing is anemia, \\2.0\\\\R\
345\663\D\1.1200\2.100\you know low red cells can cause fatigue, \\2.0\\\\R\
345\664\D\1.1500\2.100\but I see you've exactly had an excellent level of those.  \\2.0\\\\P\
345\665\D\1.1500\2.100\41 is your max, \\2.0\\\\P\
345\666\D\1.1200\2.610\so that's not a concern, \\2.0\\\\P\
345\667\D\1.1500\2.100\but that's one of the things we look for. \\2.0\\\\R\
345\668\D\1.1400\2.400\ So um I think it's worth you know, \\2.0\\\\P\
345\669\D\1.1400\2.400\it sounds like a real problem to me \\2.0\\\\R\
345\670\D\1.1500\2.400\and I think it's worth investigating.\\2.0\\\\R\
346\671\P\1.1400\2.430\You know, I agree with you.\\2.0\\\\R\
347\672\D\1.1400\2.400\With your, you know, obviously when you're taking better care of yourself, then that may improve. \\2.0\\\\P\
